DAP condemns Vietnamese incursion into Thai territory and calls for an International Conference on the 18-month Vietnamese military occupation of Kampuchea

The DAP condemns Vietnamese incursion and violation of Thai territory. It is a demonstration of Vietnamese perfidy and its threat to the peace and stability of South East Asia.</u>

ASEAN nations must react as one to the latest Vietnamese aggression, and give added resolve to ASEAN nations to redouble their efforts to harness international support for effective checks to Vietnamese expansionist designs.

In this connection, the DAP calls for an International Conference, preferably U.N.-sponsored, on the 18-month Vietnamese military occupation of Kampuchea, to secure maximum international agreement on an end to the Vietnamese violation of Kampuchean national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The DAP suggests that an international peace-keeping force be formed under the auspices of the United Nations to liberate Kampuchea from the Vietnamese military occupation, and that the ASEAN nations take the joint initiative in the United Nations to get such an international peace-keeping force established.

Pressure at all international levels must also be applied on Soviet Union for aiding and abetting its client-state, Vietnam, in its military expansionism in Kampuchea and Thailand.

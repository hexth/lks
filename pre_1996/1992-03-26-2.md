# DAP calls on the Public Services Department to revise its Sistem Saraan Baru (SSB) for the police force commensurate with other services as the SSB proposals have created widespread dissatisfaction and lowered the morale of all police ranks.

The Sistem Saraan Baru (SSB) proposals for the police force has created widespread dissatisfaction and lowered the morale of all police ranks, as they are generally placed in a disadvantaged position when compared with other services.</u>

The 'remuneration for all police ranks, like the Commissioner of Police, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Assistant Commissioner  of Police, Inspector, Sub-Inspector, Sergeant, and the police constable compare unfavourably with their counterparts in other services like the Armed Forces, Customs and even the civilian departments.

This is most unfair and unjust to the entire police force and the Public Services Department should give an immediate undertak¬ing to revise the SSB proposals for all ranks of the police force so that morale in the police forces would not suffer.

DAP may have differences with the police over individual incidents or over particular police measures, but the DAP appreciates the important role played by the entire police force in the country in maintaining a law and order.

The DAP is strongly of the view that in devising the remu¬nerations for the police under the SSB, if the Public Services Department, should err at all, it should err in favour of giving the police personnel greater remuneration in recognition of their important role in maintaining the law and order in the country.

I also call on the Inspector General of Police, Tan Sri Haniff Omar, to take up the case of the entire police force for a better and more equitable remuneration under the SSB.

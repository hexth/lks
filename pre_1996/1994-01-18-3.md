# The international conference of Parliamentarians on Bosnia-Herzagovina in Kuala Lumpur this weekend should designate a date as ‘ Bosnia Day’ to mobilese all Parliaments of the world to meet on the same day to condemn Serbian aggression and violation of Bosnian sovereignty and to demand international action to end ethnic cleasing and atrocities.


The international conference of Parliamentarians on Bosnia-Herzagovina in Kuala Lumpur this weekend should designate a date as ‘ Bosnia Day’ to mobilize all Parliaments of the world to meet on the same day to condemn Serbian aggression and violation of Bosnian sovereignty and to demand international action to end ethnic cleasing and atrocities perpetrated by the serbs against the Bosnians.</u>

One of the greatest challenges of the international conference of Parliamentarians on Bosnia- Herzegovina in Kuala Lumpur is to develop a strategy to combat the growing apathy among the international community to the genocide in the devastated and strife-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina.

It is such weariness of the International community to the incessant killings and sufferings of the Bosnian people which has partly resulted in the ineffective , impotent and immoral failure of the United Ntions , the United States and other Nato countries to end the second holocaust in the heart of Europe.

In Geneva yesterday , Ministers from Malaysia, Iran , Pakistan , Senegal , Tunisia , Turkey , Saudi Arabia and Egypt – the contact grup on Bosnia of the 51 member Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) – met with Bosnia’s Muslim leaders on the eve of another new round of peace talks with croats and serbs.

It has been reported that the OIC States were contemplating economic action – some kind of Islamic botcott – against western states working against the interests of the Bosnian Muslims.

The OIC states should be careful so as not project the Bosnian conflict as a battle between Muslims versus non- Muslims , but a battle of the entitle humanlity against barbarity and savagery and any action they contemplate should appeal to the entire human race , and not to people of a particular faith only.

The OIC States can propose the launching of an international economic botcott against western states which had obstructed the implement of United nations Security council resolutions to restore the national sovereignty of Bosnia –herzegovina and to establish Sarajevo and other areas in Bosnia as ‘ safe havens’  but it must not be presented as an Islamic boycott but a boycott of all civilized nations and peoples.

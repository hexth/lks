# Tan Sri Manickavasagam’s statement in Parliament a ‘big disappointment’

Tan Sri Manickavasagam’s statement in Parliament on the MAS 737 highjacking and mid-air explosion leading to 100 deaths is most disappointing.

He has not said very much new. And what is most important he has left unsaid. This is with regard to security arrangements in the various airports to fish out would-be hijackers.</u>

This is a matter which should have been dealt with by the Minister, for it is because the lax security situation in the Penang airport that has resulted in the MAS Boeing 737 tragedy.

The tightening of security arrangements should be immediately effected, Malaysians are tired of promises by Ministers to ‘review’ security arrangements after a major tragedy has taken place, when in the first place, the authorities concerned should have the foresight and competence to ensure that there had been effective security arrangements in the various airports in the country.

A clear Ministerial statement on the security situation in the various airports cannot be delayed any longer.

# I will produce proof on October 5 that Datuk Seri Ling Liong Sik colluded with Tan Sri Rahim Tamby Cik ten years ago in the unsuccessful conspiracy to demolish Bukit China

DAP Central Executive Commitee has decided to organise nation-wide-year-long celebrations to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the successful and historic DAP Save Bukit China campaign ten years ago beginning on October 5, 1993.</u>

The DAP Save Bukit China campaign is the most successful demonstration of ‘People’s Power’, where the the people from all over the country united as one to defend their historic, cultural and fundamental citizenship rights.

When the DAP first launched the Save Bukit China campaign, there was considerable pessimism as the people did not have confidence that they could stop the Malacca Chief Minister Tan Sri Rahim Tamby Cik from proceeding with his plan to demolish Bukit China and develop it into a commercial complex.

The successful DAP Save Bukit China campaign was an eye-opener to the people that they possessed power when they unite together to force the government to heed their just demands.

This is why it is important for the future defence of our fundamental rights that the future generations are made to fully understand and cherish the memory of the great Save Bukit China campaign ten years ago.

We must not forget history, or allow anyone to blacken the memory of the historic Save Bukit China campaign ten years ago, or we will just be like giving up our roots, and jeoparidise our rights and those of our future generations in this country.

We believe that the great contributions made by everyone in the Save Bukit China struggle should become the precious memory of the people – in particular, the firm and unyielding stand of the Cheng Hoon Teng Chairman, the late Ee Yew Lin.

Similarly, the role of the ‘villains’ in this Bukit China struggle – those who for their own personal and political interests were prepared to go against the entire Chinese community and conspire with Rahim Tamby Cik to demolish Bukit China – should also be remembered.

At the launching of the Tenth Anniversary Nation- Wide Celebrations to commemorate the great and successful DAP Save Bukit China campaign on October 5, 1993, I will produce proof that the MCA President, Datuk Seri Dr.Ling Liong Sik, colluded with the Malacca Chief Minister, Tan Sri Rahim Tamby Cik, ten years ago in the unsuccessful conspiracy to demolish Bukit China.

We have picked October 5, 1993 to launch off the nation-wide year-long activities to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the DAP Save Bukit China campaign because it was on October 5, 1983 that Rahim Tamby Cik wrote his first letter to Cheng Hoon Teng, the Bukit China trustees, declaring his intention to demolish Bukit China.

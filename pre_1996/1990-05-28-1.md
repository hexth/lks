# DAP condemns the arrest of three Sabahans under ISA and calls for their immediate release

DAP condemns the arrest of three Sabahans under the Inter¬nal Security Act. DAP calls for their immediate release. If the police have any evidence against them for having committed any of¬fences, they should he charged and tried in court.</u>

Sabah Commissioner of Police, Datuk Haji Syed Othman Syed Ali, has confirmed their arrest on Friday, and they have been identi¬fied as Parti Bersatu Sabah Youth Exco member, Chairman of Sabah Air and PBS representative on the National Economic Consultative Council (NECC), Benedict Topin, ex-policeman Albinus Yudah and a third identi¬fied only as Vincent.

DAP is opposed to the use of the ISA detention laws without trial as a gross violation of basic human right of Malaysians.

I call on the Gerakan President and Primary Industries, Datuk Dr. Lim Keng Yaik, who claims to have a special relationship with PBS, to raise the ISA arrests of the three Sabahans on Wednesday’s Cabinet meeting, and to demand their immediate release.

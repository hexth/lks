# DAP seriously concerned about the worsening of relations between the UMNO government leaders and the Rulers

DAP is seriously concerned about the worsening of relations between the UMNO government leaders and the Rulers.</u>

‘Istana-bashing’ has become the favourite ploy of certain UMNO leaders who want to distract public attention from their faults and weaknesses.

There is no doubt that if an analysis is made, it will be found that those who indulge in ‘istana-bashing’ most are those who have the most faults and weaknesses.

Yesterday, the Selangor Mentri Besar, Tan Sri Muhammad Haji Muhammad Taib, announced that the Selangor UMNO liaison committee and the State Government have decided to withdraw their respective lists of candidates for various honours in conjunction with the Sultan of Selangor’s 66th birthday next month.

Tan Sri Muhammad said that this decision was to protest against the decision by the palace to only award Datukships to Federal officials.

Tan Sri Muhammad has made a name for himself as a well-known ‘istana-basher’. Is Tan Sri Muhammad prepared to be publicly examined as to whether he has any axe to grind in his role as an ‘istana-basher’, and whether he is trying to hide his faults and weaknesses?

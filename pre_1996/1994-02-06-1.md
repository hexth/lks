# I am prepared to fully co-operate and assist the Police in its investigations into the bribery of Malaysian politicians by Australian secret inteligence agency

I am prepared to fully co-operate and assist the Police in its investigations into the bribery of Malaysian politicians by Australian secret intelligence agency.</u>

The Minister for Law, Datuk Syed Hamid Albar, in a Berita Harian report today under the heading 'Kit Siang diminta bantu siasatan', was reported to have said in Kota Tinggi “Ketua Pembangkang Lim Kit Siang, perlu bekerjasama membantu siasatan polis bagi membolehkan pihak berkuasa bertindak terhadap mereka yang menyalurkan maklumat negara kepada Perkhidmatan Perisikan Sulit Australia (ASIS}”.

Hamid said “Lim perlu membuktikan sikap kepemimpinan dan semangat . patriotiknya dengan membantu siasatan berkenaan bagi mengenal pasti mereka terbabit.”

The patriotism and nationalism of DAP leaders is second to none to leaders in UMNO and the Barisan Wasicnal, and nobody should at this stage raise such extraneous issues. Otherwise, the DAP can also raise  the question of patriotism and nationalism of UMNO and Barisan Nasional leaders, as the Canberra Times report of February 3 had cleared opposition politicians and pin-pointed government politicians and UMNO leaders as the politicians bribed by Australian agents.

I am prepared to meet the Inspector-General of Police, Tan Sri Rahim Mohamed Noor or the special police investigation committee to give them all assistance to trace the government politicians and UMNO leaders implicated in the Australian ASIS bribery network. All that need to do is to give me a telephone call, and I will immediately fix an appointment to meet them.

I am sure all Malaysians would want to know who are the government, politicians and UMNO leaders who had been bribed by the ASIS agents until four years ago.

The -question is not whether I or DAP leaders would co-operate and assist the Police with its investigations, but whether UMNO and Barisan Nasional leaders are prepared to give such assistance themselves.

I hope Barisan Nasional and UMNO leaders would publicly, declare their readiness to extend their fullest co-operation and assistance to the Police in its investigations, especially after the Canberra Times report clearing Opposition politicians and pin-pointing government politicians and UMNO leaders as the ones who had been bribed by the Australian spies.

The Police, on its part, mast demonstrate that it is carrying out an independent and professional investigation and not playing any ‘political game’!

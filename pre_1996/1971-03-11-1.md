The Speaker, 

Dewan Ra’ayat,

Parliament.

Sir,

I have been instructed by my Parliament Group of 13 DAP Members of Parliament to lodge an official protest against the unfair allocation of time for DAP Members in he Constitution Amendment Bill debate and in the debate on the Yang di-Pertuan Agong’s Royal Address.</u>

We had six to eight MPs who wanted to participate in de debate on the Yang di-Pertuan Agong’s Royal Address, but until 6.15 p.m. yesterday, the third and last day of the debate for backbenchers and the Opposition, not a single DAP MP had been called. In protest, we shall boycott the rest of the current Parliament meeting.

Yours sincerely,

Sgd.

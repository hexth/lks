_Speech by Parliamentary Opposition Leader, DAP Secretary-General, MP for Petaling, Lim Kit Siang, when officially launching the DAP’s campaign to get Kin Kwok Daily News readers to boycott Kin Kwok Daily News because of its irresponsible and vicious campaign to character-assassinate DAP leaders at a function held at Perak State premises on Wednesday, 13th May 1981 at 11.30 a.m._

# The future of Malaysian Chinese can only be secured if ‘degenerates of the race’ like those who write and are responsible for Kin Kwok Daily News articles seeking to character-assassinate DAP leaders are exposed.

Recently, there have been many calls for Chinese Unity and talk about the future of Malaysian Chinese, but we find that some of those who talk most about Chinese Unity and the future of Malaysian Chinese are also the ‘degenerates of the race’ whose actions gravely damage the position and future of Malaysian Chinese in the country.</u>

The future of Malaysian Chinese only be secured if the ‘degenerates of the race’ are exposed, so that they are not allowed to detract and undermine the work, commitment and sacrifice of those who have dedicated themselves to the betterment of Malaysian Chinese and future generations, apart from other racial groups, in Malaysian for eternity.

These ‘degenerates of the race’ are not confined to the political field, but are also to be found in other fields.

A good example is the sustained and systematic campaign conducted by Kin Kwok Daily News, since it was taken over by Gerakan Belia Bersatu and came under the personal direction of GBB President, Tee Ann Chuan, which sought January to character-assassinate DAP leaders and destroy the credibility confidence and trust of the people in the DAP.

I personally came under a prolonged venomous and irresponsible attack in the Kin Kwok Daily News, where I was accused of being dictatorial, a dubious character, a Special Branch agent, of oppressing and suppressing the Chinese educated, and such wild charged escalated to others accusing me not only of being anti-Chinese educated, but also of being anti-Chinese, and lately, of being more a Chinese as having ‘lost the spirit of the descendants of Huan Ti’!

Kin Kwok Daily News, even since Tee Ann Chuan’s personal take-over, carried lies and falsehoods about me and the DAP, while claiming to be concerned about the future of the Malaysian Chinese.

Car Tee Ann Chuan and Kin Kwok Daily News explain what good would be served through the character-assassination and destruction of the Chinese leaders in the DAP?

Would Tee Ann Chuan land the Kin Kwok Daily News dare to run the venomous and irresponsible campaign against Lee San Choon, Lim Chong Eu or Lim Keng Yaik in the way they went for the DAP leaders?

Tee Ann Chuan and the Kin Kwok Daily News dare not, not only because the press would be closed down under the Internal Security Act (remember 1974 when all speeches and statements by the so-called ‘reformists’ in the MCA attacking Tun Tan Siew Sin and Datuk Lee San Choon after the expulsion of Lim Keng Yaik were banned in the press), but even more important, because this would not serve the ulterior purpose of Tee Ann Chuan and Kin Kwok Daily News.

# Kit Siang invites Liong Sik to jointly meet the Kelantan State Government leaders for the MCA leader to bring up the MCA allegation that the Kelantan State Government had carried out over 60 Islamisation programmes adversely affecting non-Muslim rights in the past year

Yesterday, I said that after the current Parliamentary meeting I propose to visit Kelantan to take up the offer of the Kelantan State Government to meet with Kelantan State Government leaders about its policies and programmes and the sensitives and rights of non-Muslims.</u>

I want today to publicly invite the MCA President, Datuk Dr. Ling Liong Sik, to join me in the meeting with Kelantan State Government leaders so that at this joint meeting, the MCA leader could bring up the MCA allegation that in the past one year, the Kelantan State Government had carried out over 60 Islamisation programmes adversely affecting non-Muslim rights.

Let me assure Liong Sik of my full support, both at the meeting with the Kelantan State Government leaders and in public, if he could produce evidence that in the past one year , the Kelantan State Government had carried out over 60 Islamisation programmes adversely affecting non-Muslim rights.

If I were Liong Sik, and I have full possession of the proofs that in the past one year the Kelantan State Government had carried 60 Islamisation programmes adversely affecting non-Muslim rights, I will never miss the opportunity for a face-to-face confrontation with the Kelantan State Government leaders.

So that Liong Sik will not feel alone or isolated, he could bring the other three MCA Ministers along as well to the meeting with the Kelantan State Government leaders.

This is a very serious invitation and proposition on my part and I hope that Liong Sik will take it equally seriously.

There is no use for Liong Sik and the MCA leaders shouting that the Kelantan State Government had carried out over 60 Islamisation programmes adversely affecting non-Muslim rights if they are not prepared to confront the Kelantan State Government leaders or to produce a full list of them convince all Malaysians.

_DAP Secretary-General and Member of Parliament for Bandar Melaka, Mr. Lim Kit Siang, today (9.2.1974) issued the following statement:_

# Lim Kit Siang to visit political detainees in Batu Gajah and Taiping

After consultation and with agreement of relatives of political detainees in Batu Gajah and Taiping, I have asked the Ministry of Home Affairs for permission to meet some of the leaders of the political detainees in both Batu Gajah and Taiping detention camps to see for myself the actual conditions there.</u>

The hunger strike by the political detainees, which is entering the 43rd day in Batu Gajah detention camp, and the 29th day in Taiping detention camp, is a matter of grave national and international concern.

The DAP repeats out call for a public inquiry into the death of Wong Sooi Seng from Yong Peng, in December last year, and allegations of police brutalities against the detainees.

The Ministry of Home Affairs has informed me that I could meet the detainees after February 15. I will therefore be meeting some of the detainees in Batu Gajah detention camp next Saturday, February 16.

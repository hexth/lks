# Dap deplores new Education Ministry policy to refuse to allow Boards of Managements in new Chinese primary schools

In reply to my question in Parliament yesterday about the Tsun Jin S hool (II) affair the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education, Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, said it is the policy of the Barisan Nasional Government not to allow new Chinese primary schools or schools which the Minister of Education consider as new schools to have Boards of Management.</u>

The DAP deplores this new policy of the Barisan Nasional government, which is completely in contrary to the pledge given by Dato Hussein Onn in Parliament in 1972 that the Government would not do away with Boards of Managements of Chinese primary schools.

When the Education Minister announced this policy also present in the House was the Deputy Education Minister and MCA Youth Leader, Mr. Chian Siang Sum, and MCA and Gerakan MPs and Assemblymen

The people of Malaysia have a right to know why Mr. Chian Siang Sum, as Deputy Minister of Education and the MCA gave support to this new policy concerning Boards of Management of Chinese primary schools.

In fact, was Mr. Chian Siang Sum consulted, and his views sought, before this new policy was decided upon?

I await clarification from both Mr. Chian Siang Sum and the MCA.

_Parliamentary Opposition Leader and DAP Secretary General, Mr. Lim Kit Siang today issued the following statement on the demise of Tun Abdul Razak bin Hussein;_

# I was shocked and grieved to learn of Tun Razak’s untimely death when I was in Kuching late last night.

Tun Razak’ s death is a loss to the country, especially at this time, when the country needed firm, wise and experienced leadership to guide Malaysia through what may be the most decisive and crucial phase of Malaysian nationhood.</u>

Tun Razak has given his life in the service of the nation, and the people of Malaysia will forever salute and honour his memory for his sacrifice and dedication.

Tun Razak’s death is mourned by all Malaysians, regardless of race.

I never knew that when I  saw him on Dec.16 at his residence where he gave a reception for Members of Parliament that it would be the last time.

I have sent a telegram of condolence to Toh puan Rahah and his children. The telegram reads:

Toh Puan Rahah,

Please accept my deepest condolences and sympathies on the untimely death of Tun Razak.

The whole nation mourns with you and your children in the loan of a great Malaysian nationalist and leader who had dedicated his entire life to the services of the nation.

# PAS will forfeit all political support and sympathy from the Chinese and non-Muslims in Malaysia if it disregards non-Muslim views and sensitivities and infringes on the non-Muslim way of life with its new regulations banning public sale and consumption of alcohol from July 1					   

PAS will forfeit all political support and sympathy from the Chinese and non-Muslims in Malaysia if it disregards non-Muslim views and sensitivities and infringes on the non-Muslim way of life with its new regulations banning public sale and consumption of alcohol from July 1</u>

PAS will have to pay a very heavy political price if it is not prepared to respect the views, sensitivities, customs and way of life of the Chinese and non-Muslims in Malaysia by enforcing the new regulation in Kelantan on public sale and consumption of alcohol, and requiring Chinese dinners and functions to apply for approval and licensing from the local authorities for the use of alcohol.

DAP will continue to be consistent in defending the basic and consistent in defending the basic and constitutional rights of Malaysia, Muslims and non-Muslims, and is prepared to take any action, including legal action, whether it is UMNO or PAS which is violating the rights.

The Kelantan Mentri Besar, Nik Aziz Nik Mat, should reconsider the State Governmentâ€™s proposal to introduce the ban on public sale and consumption of alcohol affecting non-Muslims, for it will have nation-wide repercussions in arousing non-Muslim alienation against PAS not only in Kelantan but throughout Malaysia. Such an action by the PAS-led Kelantan State Government will only confirm UMNO allegations that PAS policies are completely unsuitable for a multiracial and multi-religious society like Malaysia.

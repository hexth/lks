# DAP Penang welcomes suspension of the Penang ferry fares increases which is a 'slap in the face1 for Koh Tsu Koon and shows the result of tenacity of DAP Assemblymen in the Penang State Assembly

DAP Penang welcomes the suspension of the Penang ferry fares increases which is to be implemented from tomorrow. This shows the result of the tenacity of the DAP Assemblymen in the Penang State Assembly

The Penang ferry fares increases was one of the main topics raised by the Penang DAP Assemblymen in the recent Penang State Assembly, where we reminded the Penang Chief Minister, Dr. Koh Tsu Koon, of his earlier statement that the Penang Port Commission should not increase the ferry fares and burden the people.</u>

However, Tsu Koon had forgotten his earlier statement as well as the statement issued by the Penang Barisan Nasional backbenchers in May protesting against the ferry fares increase, for in the Penang State Assembly in June, he defended the ferry fares increases from August  1 on the ground that they had not been increased since 1959.

In view of Tsu Koonâ€™s stout defence of the ferry fares increases, the decision of the Cabinet to suspend the ferry fares increases is a "slap in the face" for the Penang Chief Minister - as he should have been more aware of the needs of the people of Penang.

In fact, in the State Assembly, I questioned the role of the MIC Assemblyman for Prai ,V. Muthusamy, for failing to uphold the interests of the people of Penang in agreeing to the ferry fares increases in his capacity as a member of the Board of PPC.

The suspension of the Penang ferry fares increases should be a lesson to the Penang Chief Minister to be more responsive to the needs of the people and more respectful of the views expressed by DAP Assemblymen in the Penang State Assembly.

# DAP MPs will ask for an emergency sitting of Parliament if there is a cover-up of the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal after 16 months of investigation by the Anti-Corruption Agency

I am very concerned with the statement by the Attorney-General, Tan Sri Abu Talib Othman yesterday that the ACA Director-General, Tan Sri Zulkifli Mahmood will decide on the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal today or early next week.</u>

Until yesterday, Tan Sri Abu Talib had been declaring that he would make the final decision as Attorney-General as to whether there was a case for prosecution in the ACAâ€™s MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal involving the MIS President and Minister for Energy, Telecommunication and Posts.

His extraordinary statement yesterday that the final decision is now with the ACA has created the inescapable impression that the Attorney-General is preparing the public for an announcement that no action whatsoever would be taken in the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal and he wants the public to believe that this decision is that of the ACA Director-General and not his.

If this proves to be the case, then the cover-up of the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal is an even greater scandal than the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal itself.

DAP MPs will demand an emergency sitting of Parliament if there is a cover-up of the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal after 16 months of investigation by the Anti-Corruption Agency and no one is going to be arrested and prosecuted for the abuses of power and malpractices defrauding the MAIKA shareholders.

YB Tan Sri,

# Standing Order 18(1) to move an adjournment of the House on a matter of urgent, definite public importance

This is to give notice under Standing Order 18(2) that I wish to move the following motion to seek leave of the House to adjourn the House on a matter of urgent, definite public importance, namely, the position of the YAP Ghafar Baba as Deputy Minister as to whether he enjoys the confidence of Parliament:</u>

“That this House gives leave to the Ketua Pembangkang, YB Lim Kit Siang under S.O.18 to adjourn the House on a matter of urgent, definite public importance, namely, the position of the YAP Ghafar Baba as Deputy Minister as to whether he enjoys the confidence of Parliament, as this is a matter of urgent, definite public importance for the following reasons:

“Firstly, the statement by the Chairman of the Backbenchers Club (BBC) , YB Shahidan Kassim last Thursday that the majority of UMNO MPs would nominate Finance Minister, YB Datuk Anwar Ibrahim to contest the post of UMNO deputy president so as to become Deputy Prime Minister tantamount to an open expression of no confidence by the majority of UMNO MPs in YAB Ghafar Baba as Deputy Minister;

“Secondly, the withdrawal of support for YAB Ghafar Baba by the majority of UMNO MPs, who form the backbone of Barisan Nasional MPs, has compromised and undermined the position of YAB Ghafar Baba as Deputy Prime Minister and raised the question as to whether he could effectively, honorably and credibly continue as Deputy Prime Minister;

“Thirdly, the statement by the Chairman of the BBC has created a political, government, parliamentary and constitutional crisis because:

(a)	it is politically and constitutionally improper that YAB Ghafar Baba should continue as Deputy Prime Minister when he has lost the confidence of Parliament as signified by withdrawal of support by the majority of UMNO MPs;

(b)	if YAB Ghafar Baba continue as Deputy Prime Minister under these circumstances, he would become a ‘lame-duck’ Deputy Prime Minister for the next four months, not only ineffective in government and inside the country, but project a bad international image for the country as well;

“Fourthly, the urgency that before Dewan Rakyat adjourns sine dine until the budget meeting next October, Parliament must take clear as to whether YAB Ghafar Baba still commands the confidence of Parliament, and in particular the majority of UMNO MPs; so that:

(a)	if he still commands the confidence of Parliament, and in particular the majority of the UMNO MPs, YB Ghafar Baba can continue as Deputy Prime Minister with full credibility, effectiveness and authority; or

(b)	if he has lost the confidence of Parliament, and in particular the majority of the UMNO MPs, YAB Ghafar Baba can gracefull resign as Deputy Prime Minister so that he would not become a ‘lame duck’ Deputy Prime Minister for the next four months and allow a new Deputy Prime Minister to be appointed immediately.”

Thank you. 


Yours sincerely,
Lim Kit Siang
(Lim Kit Siang)
Ketua Pembangkang

# MPPP councilors who are not prepared to take a firm stand on the Hotel Metrpole and Taman Midlands scandals should not take their oath of office tomorrow

Tomorrow , the MPPP councilors appointed by the Pennag Chief Moinister , Dr Koh  Tsun Koon , last Tuesday for this year would take their oath of office.</u>

MPPP Councillors who are not prepared to take a firm stand on the Hotel Metropole and taman Midlands sacandals should not take their oath of office tomorrow and should seriously reconsider as to whether they can be true to the oath of office they would have to take serve the higher interest of the rateplayers and the people on Penang Island.

At present, MPPP Councillors seems to be appointment to serve the interests of their respective political parties in the Barisan Nasional rather than the interest of the rateplayers.

The immediate tasks of the MPPP Councillors is to give the topmost priority to deal with the two MPPP scandals of the demolition of Hotel Metropole and the Taman Midlands ‘ One Stop Centre’ Project .

The MPPP will become the laugjing stock of local government , not only in Malaysian , but throughout the world , if heritage buildings on the MPPP conservation list could be destroyed in a Christmas Day’ lighting demolition’.

The MPPP will become the greatest scandal of local government in Malaysia as well as in the world if the MPPP either through its President of Councillors , had connived in the demolition of Hotel Metropole of had prior knowledge of the proposed demolition of an important part of Penang tradition , heritage , culture , and history and had not taken any action to prevent such demolition.

The Taman Midlands ‘ One Stop Centre’ scandal has become more apparent since the DAP fisrt raised it in Penang State Assembly more than a month ago.

The highlands of the Taman Midlands ‘ one Stop Centre’ scandal are:

Violation of the Local Governmnet Act 1976 by MPPP in giving 99-year lease of Taman Midlands land to Pangkal Permata (M) Sdn. Bhd without consent from the State Authority;

The irregular tender process in rejecting the highest bidder , Grand Eastern Rcalty & development Sdn . Bhd which is RM3 Million higher than Pangkal Permata Sdn . Bhd

The illegal sale of shoplot and condominium units of Taman Midlands ‘ one –stop centre’ without planning approval , sale and advertising permit or developer’s licence and illegal collection of booking fees running tens of millions of ringgit and

The MPPP bending of rules , regulations and laws with regard to the planning applications for the Taman Midlands ‘ One Stop Centre ‘ as for instance , allowing Pangkal Permata to put up a ‘ one stop centre’ billboard at the site without MPPP permit 
 
The new MPPP councilors must also learn from the lessons od the Highlenad towers Collapse Disaater , where over 70 lives were lost , by taking action to freeze dangerous hillslope construction work until independent counsultants have certified that it is safe on grounds of safety and environment.

One such hillslope construction project is the private bungalow of Tan Gim Hwa under construction on Pearl Hill.

After the highland Towers Collapse Disaster , the Minister for Science , Technology and Enviroment , Datuk Law Heng Ding , announced that the government proposes to classify hill slopes according to their gradients to ensure sufficient safety measures are taken when carrying out construction work.

Slopes with gradient of live to 20 degress have been categorized as ‘ gentle slopes’ 20 to 20 degrees as dangerous slopes and 30 degrees and above as ‘ critical slopes’ .

A study should be made as to whether Tan Gim Hwa ‘s private bungalow under construction on Pearl Hill is dangerous slope . The MPPP councillors on Pearl Hill is a dangerous slope. The MPPP councilors should be prepared to take action against another bungalow under construction on Pearl Hill which is definitely on a ‘ critical slope’ as it seems to be on a slope which exceeds 40 degrees.

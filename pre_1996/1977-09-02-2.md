# The unauthorised higher bus fare by Sri Jaya a open defiance of the government: DAP wants immediate action

The increase in bus fares by Sri Jaya bus company in PJ and Kuala Lumpur is an open defiance of the government, and if stern and immediate action is not taken, similar defiant actions will be taken by bus companies throughout the country – causing untold hardships and in-convenience to low-income commuters and school children.

The reasons given by Sri Jaya that the increase was not an “increase” but merely an “adjustment”, and that it was all a mistake is completely unacceptable.</u>

The statement by a company spokesman that it would take a week to “re-adjust” is completely unacceptable, and shows either a complete disregard of the Bus Company’s public duties and obligations, or a shocking incompetence and inefficiency in the Sri Jaya.

Unless the Government can react-swiftly and quickly to immediately punish the Sri Jaya Company, the Government will itself be proved to be ineffective and incompetent.

The bus companies are trying to fight a war of nerves with the public. Where does the Government stand?

# DAP Constitutional and Human Rights Committee to meet next week to consider whether to sue MPMT over Bukit Beruang incident for violating Article 8 of Constitution			

The DAP Constitutional and Human Rights Committee, headed by Karpal Singh, will early next week to consider whether to sue the MPMT over the Bukit Beruang incident, where MPMT enforcement officers set fire to 11 hawker stalls, for violating Article 8 of the Malaysian Constitution, and to ask for damages.</u>

Article 8 of the Malaysian Constitutional protects every Malaysian citizen from racial discrimination.

I am very sad that the MCA MPMT Councillors seemed to be completely indifferent to the fundamental principles involved in the Bukit Beruang incident. The Malacca MCA MPMT Councillors are engaged in a ‘life-and-death’ power struggle in the MCA, claiming to be the champions of the self-respect, dignity and interests of the Malaysian Chinese. But the MCA factions seem to be very good in doing their utmost to try to defeat their MCA rivals, but when faced with UMNO leaders, whether state or even mere Municipal Council officials, they show themselves to be very tame and docile.

The DAP calls on the three MCA factions of Neo Yee Pan, Tan Koon Swan and Mak Hon Kam, to declare their stand on the Bukit Beruang incident.

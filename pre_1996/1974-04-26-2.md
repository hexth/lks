# Detention of three more officials of the Chun Lei Cultural Night: Lim Kit Siang writes to Ghazalie Shafie expressing concern

I have written to the Minister of Home Affairs, Tan Sri Ghazalie Shafie, expressing concern at the arrest of three more official of the Chun Lei Cultural Night, in aid of the Chinese Independent Secondary Schools.

My letter to the Minister reads:</u>

“Dear Tan Sri,

I have been informed that three more organisers of the Chun Lei Cultural Night to be held at the Chinese Assembly Hall beginning this Sunday in aid of Chinese Independent Secondary Schools have been arrested two days ago.

They are: 1. Lai Hoo Lan, stage manager
                 2. Wong See Chor, treasurer
                 3. Ng Guan Leong, supervisor, dancer

In the last two months, six officials and members of the Chun Lei Cultural Show Organising Committee have been detained by the police.

They were:
1. Goh Kean Seng, 24, (President of the Committee);
2. Chong Ling, 35, (Vise President)
3. Soo Kok Choy, 27;
4. Wu Chang Yong, 27;
5. Liew Kok Meng, 23; and
6. Wong Chong Meng, 25.

I am gravely concerned about these arrests, under the Internal Security Act. They should be brought to court to face open charges, or be freed so that they can continue to make their contribution to the organisation of the Chun Lei Cultural Show, in aid of Chinese Independent Secondary Schools.

I hope you can personally look into this matter, and allay the anxiety that is not only being felt by their near ones, but also by the public at large.


Yours sincerely,

(Lim Kit Siang)
Ahli Parlimen Bandar Melaka
DAP Secretary-General”.

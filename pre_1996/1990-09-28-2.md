# Directive to all DAP officials and members not to make any comments on the matter of Lam Thye’s resignation to allow the situation to cool off

I am issuing a directive, with instant effect, to all DAP officials and members, especially in the Federal Territory, not to make any comments to the press, whether on the record or off the record, on the matter of the resignation of Sdr. Lee Lam Thye as DAP Federal Territory Chairman.</u>

 This ban on all public comments, whether direct or indirect, on the matter of Lam Thye’s resignation is to allow the situation to cool off so that the party leadership could resolve the issue.

The emergency Central Working Committee scheduled for tomorrow is also being postponed to allow the situation to cool off.

I have met Sdr. Lam Thye four times on his resignation as DAP Federal Territory chairman. I remain optimistic that a solution could be found to the problem, especially after a five-day cooing – off period.

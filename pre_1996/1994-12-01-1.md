# DAP exposes a case of 13 multiple registration of voters using different names and address under the same identity card number

Two days ago, I revealed gross irregularities in the 1993 electoral roll where there are over 30,000 multiple or duplicate registration of voters for the same identity card number.</u>

I also referred to cases where the same identity card had been used to register different voters, with different addresses and in different constituencies.

As example, I referred to the case of identity card number 3462967 which have been used for triple registration of different voters namely:-

1. Eong joo Saik (Perempuan)
572 A, Tanjong Bunga, MK 18(20
Kod Localiti: 0471903004
Kod daerah mengundi: P047/ N19 /03
(Bukit Bendera/ Tanjong Bunga/ Kampong Tanjung Bunga)

2. Lee Hu Lim (Lelaki)
599L Jalan Tanjong Bunga, MK 18(2)
Kod localiti: 0471903004
Kod daerah mengundi: P047/ N19 /03
(Bukit Bendera/ Tanjong Bunga/ Kampong Tanjung Bunga)

3. Khatijah BT Abbas (Perempuan)
634A Batu Uban MK 13
Kod localiti: 0503004001
Kod daerah mengundi: P050/ N30 /04
(Bayan Baru/ Batu Uban/ Batu Uban)


Today I am exposing a case of 13 multiple registration of voters using the same identity card but involving 13 different names, right as women, five as men in the Lembah Pantai Parliamentary constituency in Federal Territory.

These 13 multiple registration of voters using different names but with the same identity card number are all from the Lembab Pantai Parliametary constituency as well as from Kampong Sentosa in the Teluk Kumbar area. Nine have different addresses in Kampong Sentosa while four gave unnumbered addresses.

These 13 multiple registration of voters using the same I/C number from kampong Sentosa are as follows:-

100/16 Kampong Sentosa

Bil.	No. KP		Nama							No. Rumah
1190	3876303	Ainon bt Shamsuddin
1191	3876303	Amzah b Baba						401-C
1192	3876303	Arifin b Din						34C
1193	3876303	Embon bt Mohd Rani					34C
1194	3876303	Endon bt Madih						
1195	3876303	Halimah bt Harun					170A
1196	3876303	Iyah bt Talib						79C
1197	3876303	Mathan b Din						34-C
1198	3876303	Mazlan b Jaafar
1199	3876303	Nagappan Sallan
1200	3876303	Ramilah bt Mahat					104C
1201	3876303	Shamsiah bt Abas					200-C
1202	3876303	Zaharah bt Yusop					43C

The Election Commission chairman Datuk Harun Din, in response to my revelations, said yesterday that the Election Commission will investigate into the allegation of 30,000 duplicate voters on the vertified 1993 electoral roll.

While I welcome Harun Dinâ€™s pledge to investigate the scandal of over 30,000 duplicated voters using the same I/C, there is no reason whatsoever for such mistake to be committed by the Election Commission in the preparation of the certified electoral roll, as it would have been very easy to ferret out such duplicate voters as the whole system has been computerized.

There is also no justification whatsoever for the shocking instance of 13 multiple registration of voters using the same identity card number.

It is clear that the so-called certified and final electoral list of the Election Commission is not a clean and honest one.

Election Commission should invite All-party team to investigate the scandal of 30,000 duplicate voters and how it could evade the scrutiny of the Election Commission and its sophisticated computer system

There should in fact be a full and independent investigation as to how there could be duplicate registration of over 30,000 voters using the same identity card, as well as how such 30,000 duplicated voters could escape not only the scrutiny of the Election Commission officials, but even more shocking, evade the sophisticated computer system which have been installed by the Election Commission at great public expense.

What must be even more shocking is that the Election Commission itself could not unearth the scandal of 30,000 duplicate voters in its certified 1993 electoral roll, but have to wait until the DAP has discovered and publicized the scandal.

The Election Commission should realise that with this latest expose of the scandal of 30,000 duplicate voters, its entire credibility is at stake and it should invite a commission of Inquiry comprising representatives from all political parties to investigate as to how the Election Commission could be so negligent and its computer system so faulty as not being able o detect such gross irregularities in its final electoral register.

DAP demands that all political parties should be given at least one full month to help clean the new 1994 electoral list before comfirmation or it will consider legal action to declare it null and void

In view of the scandal of the 30,000 duplicated voters in the certified 1993 electoral roll, the Election Commission should henceforth seek the cooperation of all political parties to ensure that before any new electoral register is certified, all irregularities and phantom voters should be cleaned up.

As the Election Commission is currently preparing the 199 electoral register, there must be no repetition of the scandal of 30,000 duplicate voters, or even more shocking, the scandal of 13 multiple registrations using the same I/C.

For this reason, DAP demands that all political parties should be given at least one full month to help clean the new 1994 electoral list before final confirmation or the DAP will consider legal action to go to court to declare the new electoral roll null and void.

I#  purpose taking up the offer to meet with Kelantan State Government leaders after the current Parliamentary meeting

For an experienced politician, the Kelantan Deputy Mentri Besar, Haji Abdul Halim Abdul Rahman, should know that his outburst against the DAP “for being ignorant over the Islamisation process in Kelantan” and that I should have consulted the Kelantan State Government “before making any statements from a distance” is uncalled-for and most unwarranted.</u>

I have instructed my political secretary to send to Haji Abdul Halim a copy of my statement on Tuesday which reiterated the DAP policy stand opposing any Islamisation policy, whether by Federal Government or Kelantan State Government, which adversely affects and undermines non-Muslim rights so that the Deputy Kelantan Mentri Besar will not himself speak from ignorance.

I note however the assurance by him that any Islamisation process by the Kelantan State Government would not be forced on the non-Muslims.

The DAP will hold the Kelantan State Government to this public undertaking and will oppose any programme, regulation or action where the Islamisation programme is forced on non-Muslims.

With regard to Haji Halim’s invitation to me to meet Kelantan Government representatives if I wanted to get a clear picture of the State’s Islamisation process, I propose to take up the offer to meet with Kelantan State Government leaders after the current Parliamentary meeting.

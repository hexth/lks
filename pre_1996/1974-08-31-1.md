# DAP calls on the Minister of Defence to allow retiring Air Force personnel to take a 18 month resettlement course to adjust them to civilian life

I have received complaints that Air Force personnel in the armed services who are retiring have been refused resettlement courses to adjust them to civilian life.

The Minister of Defence, Dato Hamzah, has said that the Ministry of Defence is providing 18-months course to retiring servicemen to adjust them to civilian life. I cannot understand therefore why retiring airmen in the services are discriminated against and not allowed a resettlement course period, and I call on the Minister of Defence to look into this and permit all retiring airmen a resettlement course, to prepare them to return to civilian life.

# Call on the authorities to take firm action to prevent the Peninsular States in Malaysia degenerating into another Sabah where Law and order have been gravely undermined by rampant illegal immigration	  

The DAP is gravely shocked by the cold-blooded murder of Police Constable Jidin Bin Jalil, 54, at a Rembau petrol station in Negeri Sembilan yesterday by a wanted criminal, who is believed to be an Indonesian illegal immigrant too.</u>

Despite official denials, the influx of illegal Indonesian immigrants into the Peninsular states, without stringent precaution being taken by the authorities to locate and repatriate them, have led to grave law-and-order problems, as the incidence of crimes, from petty thefts to more heinous crimes, had been on the increases.

Even the former Penang State Governor, Tun Sardon bin Jubir, and his wife, had not been spared, as they were bound and robbed by people “with Indonesian accents”.

Recently, the police had taken action to round up illegal Indonesian immigrants, but such sporadic action are rather ineffective action in the light of hundreds of thousands of illegal Indonesian immigrants who have already landed and entered the country these few years.

It is time for the government to take a firm action to prevent the Peninsular States in Malaysia from degenerating into another Sabah, where law and order have become the biggest problem as a result of unchecked and officially permitted influx of Filipino refugees.

Unless the government take firm action to deal with the problem of illegal Indonesian immigrants, law-and-order problems are going to deteriorate, and not only members of the public, but members of the police forces would become more and more victims of criminal elements in the illegal Indonesian immigrants community.

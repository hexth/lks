_Press Statement by DAP Secretary-General and MP for Kota Melaka, Lim Kit Siang, on 22.8.1982_

# With effect from yesterday, I have relinquished my position as Perak State Chairman. The Deputy Perak Chairman, Lau Dak Kee, will be the acting Perak State Chairman. 

The party has also directed the Perak State Convention scheduled to be held on Sunday, 29 August, to be postponed to October 24. The Perak 1000-people dinner in Ipoh on Sunday, 29th August, will be on as scheduled. Party leaders including Party Chairman, Dr. Chen Man Hin, and I will attend the dinner. </u>

The proper place for party problems to be discussed is inside the party and as the National Party Congress to be held in Seremban on October 8, 9 and 10, the most suitable place for the matters raised by Lim Cho Hock will be at the Congress. 

I will advice all party members and branches in Perak to refrain from a public controversy on the matter.

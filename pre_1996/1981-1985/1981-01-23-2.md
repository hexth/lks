# Call on PJ municipality to stop harassing the hawkers at PJ New Town and to allow them a peaceful Chinese New Year hawking period

The PJ municipality has recently launched a campaign against the hawkers at the PJ New Town, issuing them with summonses involving compound fines to be paid by the hawkers.

The PJ municipality should immediately stop harassing the PJ New Town hawkers, as hawking is a Malaysian way of life, which keeps down cost of living, and also provide a decent and honest means of livelihood to the people. This will also ensure that the hawkers have a peaceful Chinese New Year hawkering period.

The PJ municipality should set the lead to other town and municipal authorities in approaching the hawker problem as a socio-economic problem, and not from the stand-point of harassment or punitive approach involving summonses, compound fines, etc.

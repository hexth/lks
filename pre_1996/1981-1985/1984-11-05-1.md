# Call on Malaysian Indians to remain calm, peaceful and avoid incidents which would mar the good name of the country

Indira Ghandi’s assassination has rightly been condemned by all right-thinking people in Malaysia and all over the world. Her tragic death would be even more tragic if it should spark off communal bloodshed and chaos in India.</u>

In Malaysia, there have been isolated instances of Malaysian Sikhs being harassed and attacked.

This is most unfortunate, and I call on all Malaysian Indians to remain calm, peaceful and avoid incidents which would mar the good name of the country. 

Indira Gandhi’s assassination must arouse people to the horror and madness of violence, and not incite more resort to violence.

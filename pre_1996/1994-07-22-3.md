# DAP will respect Joseph Pairin’s decision that PBS goes I alone in Sabah in the coming Parliamentary general elections and the DAP will now prepare for multi-concerned contests in Sabah

It was reported in the press today that the PBS Chairman, Datuk Joseph Pairin Kitingan, has announced that the PBS would go it alone in Sabah in the coming Parliamentary general elections and has no intention of co-operating with the DAP.</u>

When I visited Sabah in April, I had announced the DAP’s preparedness to co-operate with PBS in the national general elections, as this also reflected the wishes of the people of Sabah.

In fact, when I met Joseph Pairin at the official opening of Parliament by the Yang di Pertuan Agong in April, I had suggested a discussion about DAP-PBS co-operation in Sabah for the coming general elections but I have yet to receive any positive response from him.

Joseph Pairin has now announced that PBS will go it alone in Sabah in the coming Parliamentary general elections more than three months after the DAP’s proposal of a DAP-PSB co-operation in Sabah.

DAP will respect Joseph Pairin’s decision that PBS goes it alone in Sabah in the coming Parliamentary general elections, although this will cause disappointment among the people of Sabah who would want to see the PBS and DAP co-operating to fight the Barisan Nasional.

DAP will now have to prepare for multi-cornered contests in the next general elections in Sabah.

# Loh Boon Siew is a great Penangite and Malaysian and his death is an irreparable loss to Penang and Malaysia

		Loh  Boon Siew is a great Penangite and Malaysian and his death is an irreparable loss to Penang and Malaysia.</u>

		In recognition of his great contribution to Penang and Malaysia, Loh Boon Siew should be honoured with a state funeral.

		Both the Malaysian and Penang State Governments should honour the contributions of Loh Boon Siew to the state and nation by forming a special memorial committee to consider ways and means to perpetuate the memory of Loh Boon Siew, so that his contributions to society and philantrophy can be example and inspiration for all Penangites and Malaysians.

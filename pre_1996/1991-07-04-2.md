# Would the ACA have the power to question Tan Sri Osman Aroff for his role in the $71 million Masjid Tanah ammunition depot scandal?

The director-general of the Anti-Corruption Agency, Haji Zulkifli Mahmood, said yesterday that the Anti-Corruption Agency (ACA?) had begun investigations into allegations of malpractices in the construction of the ammunition depot in the $71 million Masjid Tanah ammunition depot scandal.</u>

The question the people want to know is whether the ACA would have the power to question the Kedah Mentri Besar, Tan Sri Osman, for his role in the $71 million ammunition depot scandal because he was director and shareholder of Sri Kinabalu Sdn. Bhd. â€“ the company which has caused the Federal Government to lose $30 million because of sub-standard, irresponsible and negligent construction of the ammunition depot.

Would the ACA also have the power to take whatever action it deems fit and necessary against Tan Sri Osman Aroff in connection with his role in the $71 million ammunition depot scandal, or will Tan Sri Osman enjoy a special immunity because of his present position as Kedah Mentri Besar.

The ACA must give satisfactory explanation to these two questions if it is to enjoy public confidence that it is not engaged in some cosmetic investigation into the $71 million ammunition depot scandal.

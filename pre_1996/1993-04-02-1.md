# DAP welcomes UN Security Council resolution to authorise military intervention to impose no-fly zone in Bosnia-Herzegovina although it is too late and too little                                       

DAP welcomes the United Nations Security Council resolution to authorise military intervention for the first time in former Yugoslavia in approving the use of force to shoot down planes violating the no-fly ban over Bosnia-Herzegovina.</u>

The Serbs are the chief violators of the five-month old ban, with 500 violations recorded since last October, and the United Nations will lose all credibility if it allows such Serbian violations to continue with impunity.

The UN Security Council resolution has in fact come too late and too little to save Bosnians from the Serban crimes of genocide.

The United Nations Security Council and the international community must bestir itself to take all necessary actions to stop the Serbs from its armed attack and armed aggression upon the people and state of Bosnia-Herzegovina in gross violation of the United Nations Charter, including an international military force to disarm the Serbs.

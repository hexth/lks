# Call on Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed to make a statement on the reasons for the resignation of Eric Cheah as managing director of Perwaja

In an interview in the Star today, Eric Cheah was asked for the reasons for his resignation as managing director of Perwaja.</u>

The question posed was: “Talk was rife that you were pressured to resign and in fact sacked for misusing or embezzling Perwaja’s funds. What is your response.”

Eric Cheah replied that he was not surprised nor was he uupset “with such empty talk” – saying that this was the work of “business rivals and these envious of me” to smear his image.

The Malaysian public are not interested about Eric Cheah’s enemies or rivals but the prevalence of the rumours as mentioned in the question quoted is a matter of public importance.

For this reason, I call on Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed to make a statement on the reasons for the resignation of Eric Cheah as managing director of Perwaja.

If no such statement is forthcoming, I will be raising this in my parliamentary question for the budget meeting starting on October 16.

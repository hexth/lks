# Polling for Sabah state general elections most likely to fall on the weekend of February 5 and 6 , 1994,

The polling dates for Sabah state general elections are most likely to fall on weekend of February 5 and 6 , 1994

This is because it would be most unsuitable to hold the general elections campaign the  polling from February 9 , 1994 onwards as February 9 id the Chineses New Year ‘ s Eve , February 10 and 11 the Chinese New Year and from February 12 , Awal Ramadhan when Puasa Month begins.</u>

Under the law , general elections in Sabah wpuld have to be held within 60 days from the date of dissolution of the Sabbah State Assembly i.e. by March 2 ,1994 In view of the Chinese New Year and the Puasa Month , it would be most inappropriate for the Election Commission at its meeting on Friday to fix polling dates from February 9 onwards.

If polling dates are fixed for Februry 5 and 6 , there is likely to be two week general elections campaign.

It is clear that the decision of the sabah Chief Minister , Datuk Joseph Pairin Kikingan to dissolve tha Sabah State assembly to call for fresh general elections had been influenced by three factors:

The release of his brother , Dr. Jeffrey Kikingan from detention under the Internal Security Act at the Kamunting Detention Centre but still under residential restriction to Seremban and various conditions limiting his fundamental liberities;

The January 17 jugdement of the Sabah High Court on his corruption trial ; and 

The Election Commssion ‘s proposed new redelineation of electoral constituencies for Sabah , which will come into effect after its presentation and adoption by the April meeting of the Dewan Rakyat.

The Dap Central working Committee , at its meeting this weekend , will discuss the Sabah state general elections and consider the report of the Sabah DAP state Chairman , Sdr. Fung Ket Wing on the recommendations of the Sabah DAP State committee.

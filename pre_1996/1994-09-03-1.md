# Ashaari should not be detained under the Internal Security Act but should be allowed an open trial if he has violated any law of the land.

Al Arqam leader, Ashaari Muhammad, who is reported to have been brought back to Malaysia from Thailand under police custody, should be given an open trial if he has violated any law of the land, and should not be detained under the Internal Security Act.</u>

The Government’s ban on Al Arqam has raised questions concerning the Islamic faith, politics, democracy and human rights.

While non-Muslims do not want to get involved with the question of Islamic faith on the Al Arqam question, as to whether it is a deviation from the Islamic religion, there is justified cause for concern with regard to the political and human rights implications of the government’s action.

If Ashaari Muhammad is detained under the Internal Security Act without trial, then the political and human rights aspects, of the Al Arqam ban will become a very acute problem, both nationally and internationally.

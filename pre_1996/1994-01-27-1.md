# DAP welcomes higher housing allowance for armed forces and calls for housing allowance increase for police  personal

DAP welcomes the higher housing allowance for armed forces announced by the Defence Minister , Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak yesterday.</u>

Housing allowance for officers and other ranks in the armed forces who are not provided with quarters has been increased between RM40 and RM 280 a month effective January 1 this year.

However , the Ministry of Defence should undertake a further review to ascertain as to whether the increase in housing allowance is adequate for armed forces personal serving in places like Kuala Lumpur , Penang and Johore Bahru where housing rentals are high , and whether further adjustments are necessary.

DAP also calls for increase of housing allowance for the police personal, as those who could not be provided with police quarters also face great hardships serving in towns with high housing rentals.

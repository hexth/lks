# Liong Sik should apologise to fish-ball manufacturers for the million-ringgit losses suffered in the past two months as the baseless rumour of pork-mixed in the fishball was spread in the name on MCA

MCA President, Datuk Dr. Ling Liong Sik, should apologise to fish-ball manufacturers for the million-ringgit losses suffered in the past two months as the baseless rumour of pork-mixed in the fishball was spread in the name on MCA.</u>

If the baseless allegation of fishball manufacturers mixing pork in their fishball and fishcakes had not been made by MCA Youth leaders form Klang, making full use of the name of MCA, the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs and the mass media would not have given the allegation such seriousness resulting in country-wide raids and the subsequent collapse in fish-ball business.

The MCA leadership cannot keep quiet on the ‘fishball crisis’ created by MCA Youth leaders, and must not only take disciplinary action against such irresponsible action, but publicly apologise for the losses caused to the fishball business.

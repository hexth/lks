# DAP proposes that Parliament defer debate on amendments to abolish trial by jury, trial by assessors and preliminary inquiries until full consultation with the Bar Council 

The Bar Council has not been consulted before the Cabinet approved the amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code Act the Kidnapping Act 1961 to abolish trial by jury, trial by assessors and preliminary inquiries.</u> 

Yesterday, these amendment bills were presented to the Dewan Rakyat for first reading and would be presented for second reading, debate and approval next week. 

As these amendments have far-reaching implications for the administration of justice in Malaysia, the government should fully consult the Bar Council before presenting it to Parliament. For this reason, DAP calls for the deferment of debate on the amendments to abolish trial by jury, trial by assessors and preliminary inquiries until the Bar Council and other organisations involved in the administration of justice are fully consulted.

# Case of the snipping-off of little finger of two-month-old baby, Muhammad Azeem Hanifah, most shocking

The case of the snipping off the little finger of two-month old baby, Muhamad Azeem Hanifah, at the Pantai Medical Centre in Kuala Lumpur last week is most shocking and outrageous.</u>

Such an incident should not have happened, especially with the promulgation of the Charter of Patient’s Rights early this month.

This case reinforces the DAP’s call for the establishment of a Patient’s Charter Council with power to receive and investigate complaints to uphold the Patient’s Charter so that the Charter could be a meaningful document protecting the rights of all patients, whether in public or private sectors.

DAP calls on the Minister of Health, Datuk Lee Kim Sai, to initiate discussions with the four organisations which had signed and endorsed the Patient’s Charter – namely the Malaysian Medical Association, the Malaysian Dental Association, the Malaysian Pharmaceutical Society and the Federation of Malaysian Consumer’s Association – to establish such a Council, which should be created by an Act of Parliament.

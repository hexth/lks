# DAP will hold Nik Aziz to his promise to DAP leaders in January 1992 that the Kelantan State Government will not change the status quo for non-Muslims as fas as the public sale and consumption of alcohol concerned

DAP will hold Nik Aziz to his promise to DAP leaders in January 1992 that the Kelantan State Government will not change the status quo for non-Muslims as fas as the public sale and consumption of alcohol concerned.</u>

The issue has becoming bigger than whether in the PAS-led Kelantan State Government, there will no infringement of the rights of the non-Muslims whether with regard to public sale and consumption of alcohol, but whether solemn pledges and undertakings given by the PAS leaders to non-Muslims would be honoured or not.

If Kelantan Mentri Besar could break his pledge to DAP leaders in his office in Kota Bahru in January 1992, then who could believe and trust in the words of PAS leaders any more?

There will be very grave and far-reaching consequences if the Kelantan Mentri Besar decides to disregard his pledge to DAP leaders to maintain the status quo with regard public sale and consumption of alcohol concerning non-Muslims, and I urge the Kelantan Mentri Besar to demonstrate that undertakings given by PAS leaders who hold the reins of government are solemn matters which taken seriously by PAS leaders themselves.

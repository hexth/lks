DAP sends its condolences to Sonia Gandhi and the people of India for the assassination of former Indian Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi.</u>

The killing of Rajiv Gandhi has sent shock waves, not only in India, but throughout the world. It should make men and women all over the world to ponder seriously on the urgent need to expunge violence in all forms from human affairs.

Democrats all over the world hope and pray at this hour of trial, India will not falter in her democratic experiment.

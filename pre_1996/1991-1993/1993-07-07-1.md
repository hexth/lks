# I have no objections if Liong Sik is accompanied by the other three MCA Ministers for the Saturday date in Malacca on the DAP Save Bukit China fund

In immediate acceptance of the challenge by MCA President, Datuk Dr.Ling Liong Sik, to make public the DAP Save Bukit China fund within a week, I had fixed the Emperor Hotel in Malacca on Saturday at 10 a.m. as the venue and date for Liong Sik to meet me personally on the DAP Save Bukit China fund.</u>

I have no objections if Liong Sik is accompanied by the other three MCA Ministers for the Saturday date in Malacca on the DAP Save Bukit China fund, if this will make him feel more confident and safer.

In the last 27 years, the DAP had been in the forefront fighting financial scandals and corruption in government and Barisan Nasional component parties, and if Liong Sik thinks he has proof that the DAP had misused public funds collected in the Save Bukit China campaign, then he has an excellent opportunity in Malacca this Saturday to expose the DAP for the first time in MCA history.

The question is whether Liong Sik has the guts to attend this Saturdayâ€™s appointment.

It was exactly 10 years ago that the Malacca State Government, with the full support of the MCA faction which comprised Ling Liong Sik, initiated the design to demolish the most ancient cemetry hill in Malaysia, Bukit China, and turn it into a profit-making centre which will create several millionaires in UMNO and MCA.

It is appropriate that ten years after the DAP had accomplished the historic task to save Bukit China from the evil designs of Malacca UMNO and the MCA, the people of Malacca and Malaysia should be reminded of the important chapter in the history not only of the Chinese community in Malaysia but in the Malaysian nation-building as well.

I had also yesterday given Liong Sik advance notice that he should come to the Malacca date on Saturday fully prepared to answer for the MCA financial scandals, including his own Bolton Finance scandal, so that he would not claim that he had not been informed in advance. 

I would not accept the explanation that he does not have firsthand information of what is in the Chinese newspapers as he could not read the Chinese press and must depend on second-hand channel for information.

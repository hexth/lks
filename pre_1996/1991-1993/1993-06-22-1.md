# PAS leaders should realise the grave political consequences if PAS-led Kelantan State Government goes ahead with its ban on public sale and consumption of alcohol affecting non-Muslims on July 2	   

PAS leaders, both at national and state levels, should realise the grave political consequences if PAS-led Kelantan State Government goes ahead with its ban on public sale and consumption of alcohol affecting non-Muslims on July l, as well as requiring Chinese and non-Muslim marriages and religious rites to apply for special approval from local authorities for the use of any alcohol.</u>

PAS leaders, in particular the Kelantan Mentri Besar, Nik Aziz Nik Mat, should understand that the uproar in Chinese and non-Muslim community not only in Kelantan but throughout Malaysia over the Kelantan State Government’s proposal to ban public sale and consumption of alcohol affecting non-Muslims from July l is not solely an alcohol question, as Chinese and non-Muslims who do not take alcohol are also very upset by the new ruling. 

If the Kelantan State Government pushes ahead with its July l ban, it means that PAS has decided on the following three policy directions: 

Firstly, that PAS has decided not to respect the constitutional rights of the Chinese and non-Muslim Malaysians. If PAS respects the constitutional tights of the Chinese and non-Muslim Malaysians, it would give serious considerations to the objections to the July l regulation and not take the arrogant attitude that the PAS-led Kelantan State Government is prepared to be taken to court. 

Secondly, that PAS has decided not to respect the views, sensitivities, way of life, custom and religious rites of the Chinese and non-Muslim Malaysians. If PAS-led Kelantan State Government wishes on moral and religious grounds to discourage excessive public consumption of alcohol, it should seek the co-operation of all the other religious, like Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism and Sikkhism and not to directly infringe with non-Muslim way of life. 

Thirdly, even more serious, PAS has decided not to honour its own word that it would not infringe on Chinese and non-Muslim rights and interests, sensitivities, way of life and religious rites. The Kelantan Mentri Besar, Nik Aziz Nik Mat, has admitted publicly that in January l992, he had given the DAP leaders and undertaking that there would be no ban on public consumption and sale of alcohol affecting non-Muslims, but this has now been dishonoured.

If PAS leaders have decided on these three policy directions in utter disregard of the constitutional rights, sensitivities, way of life, religious rites and customs of the Chinese and non-Muslim Malaysians, as well as the solemn undertaking of the Kelantan Mentri Besar, PAS will forfeit all political support and sympathy from the Chinese and non-Muslims in Malaysia and it will have to pay a very heavy political price, not only in the next general elections, but for a long time to come. 

I am prepared to go to Kota Bahru a second time to meet Nik Aziz to compress on him why the Kelantan State Government should honour his undertaking not to impose ban on public consumption and sale of alcohol affecting non-Muslims													   

DAP will continue to be consistent in defending the basic and constitutional rights of Malaysians, Muslims and non-Muslims, and is prepared to take any action, including legal action, whether it is UMNO or PAS which is violating the rights.

The Kelantan Mentri Besar, Nik Aziz Nik Mat, should reconsider the State Government’s proposal to introduce the ban on public sale and consumption of alcohol affecting non-Muslims, for it will have grave long-term repercussions not only in Kelantan but throughout Malaysia. Such an action by the PAS-led Kelantan State Government will only confirm UMNO allegations that PAS policies are completely unsuitable for a multi-racial and multi-religious society like Malaysia.

I am prepared to go to Kota Bahru a second time to meet Nik Aziz to impress on him why the Kelantan State Government should honour his undertaking that there would be no ban on public consumption and sale of alcohol affecting non-Muslims.

# Malaysia and other ASEAN governments should protest against human right violations in Myanmar as in continued detention of Aung San Suu Kyi and repression of Rohingya Muslims

Malaysia and the other ASEAN governments should protest against human right violations by the Myanmar military regime as in the continued detention of Burmese Opposition leader, Nobel Peace Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and the repression of Myanmar Muslims, known as Rohingyas.</u>

So far, about 100,000 Rohingyas had fled the western Myanmar state of Arakan into Bangladesh.

Malaysia and ASEANâ€™s commitment to human rights has not been enhanced as at the recent ASEAN Summit, no interest or concern whatever was shown by any ASEAN leader about the gross violation of human rights in Myanmar.

DAP calls on the Malaysian Foreign Ministry to take the lead to get the ASEAN Foreign Ministers to take a concerted stand to apply pressure on the Myanmar military regime to respect human rights or to review the relations between the ASEAN states and Myanmar.

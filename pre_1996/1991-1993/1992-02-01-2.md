# DAP calls on Government to ensure adequate compensation should be paid to families of RMAF pilots who perish in air crashes

DAP sends it deepest condolence to the family of RMAF pilot, Lt. Hamir Fizar Mohamed Yusof, 27, from Batu Kikir, Negri Sembilan, who died yesterday from the latest crash of the RMAF Pilatus PC-7 aircraft in Chukai, Trengganu.</u>

It is a matter of grave public concern that this is the second crash of the Pilatus PC-7 aircraft in the past three days â€“ as there was an earlier crash of the aircraft in Kepala Batas on Wednesday.

RMAF Chief, Let. Jen. Datuk Seri Mohamed Yunus Tasi, has announced the grounding of over 30 Pilatus PC-7 aircrafts based in Kuantan and Kelapa Batas pending an inquiry into their air-worthiness.

DAP calls on the Government to ensure that adequate compensation is paid to the families of RMAF pilots who perish in such air crashes.

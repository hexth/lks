# I stand by my statements in Parliament about two ‘penulis pelacur’ and am prepared to meet officials of Persatuan Wartawan Melayu Malaysia to explain why the question of public apology on my part does not arise at all

The President of Persatuan Wartawan Melayu Malaysia (PWM), Yazid Haji Pthman, issued a statement two days ago demanding a public apology from me for calling two group editors as ‘penulis pelacur’ and ‘penulis najis’ in Parliament and an undertaking that I would not repeat them in future.</u>

I stand by me statements in Parliament about two ‘penulis pelacur’ and ‘penulis najis’, and I am prepared to meet officials of PWM to explain why the question of a public apology on my part does not arise at all.

If any one should tender public apologies, ir t is the two ‘penulis pelacur’ who should publicly apologise to me.

Furthermore, I reserve the right to repeat my criticisms against the two group editors for being ‘penulis pelacur’ in future if further justified, including in the next Parliamentary meeting from October to December.

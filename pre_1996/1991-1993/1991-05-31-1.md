_By Parliamentary Opposition Leader, DAP Secretary-General and MP for Tanjung, Lim Kit Siang, in Penang on Friday, 31st May 1991:_

# Saraswathi Dewi’s death is on the conscience of those responsible for the Sunday Mail front page report.

Yesterday, I said that Madam Saraswathi Dewi would definitely be still alive today if not for a Sunday Mail front page report on Sunday which directly caused her death.</u>

I asked those responsible for the Sunday Mail report to search their conscience for their role in Saraswathi Dewi’s death.

From the New Straits Times report today, it is clear that the New Straits Times Group has no qualms whatsoever about the Sunday Mail’s role in Madam Sarawathi Dewi’s death. On the contrary, it appeared to be gloating over what it had done!

I do not propose to enter into any protracted arguments with the Sunday Mail or the New Straits Times Group over their lack of remorse in their role in Madam Sarawathi Dewi’s death.

Whatever their claims, Sarawathi Dewi’s death must be on the conscience of those responsible for the Sunday Mail report which precipitated and directly caused her death. 

If those who are responsible for the Sunday Mail report and Sarawathi Dewi’s death are utterly 
without remorse and unrepentant whatsoever, it is a matter between them and their Maker.

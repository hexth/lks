# Kit Siang writes to Liang Sik proposing to arrange a second 'mutual questioning' on DAP Save Bukit China fund in Malacca within a week if the MCA President dares to publicly state that, he is not satisfied with the DAP's announcement of the Save Bukit China One-Person One-Dollar Fund last Saturday

I have today written to the MCA President, Datuk Dr. Liong Sik, proposing to arrange a second 'mutual questioning' on the DAP Save Bukit China fund in Malacca within a week if the MCA President dares to publicly state that he is not satisfied with my announcement last Saturday of the details of the DAP Save Bukit China One-Person One-Dollar Fund to oppose the Malacca State Government $2 million quit rent demand.</u>

I had accepted the challenge of Liong Sik to produce within a week the DAP's Save Bukit China 'One Person-One Dollar' Account and invited the MCA President to the 'mutual questioning1 at Emperor Hotel, Malacca near Bukit China last Saturday.

Unfortunately, Liong Sik did not have the courage to attend the 'mutual questioning1 held as a result of his personal challenge to me.

Instead, he sent Malacca MCA national and state leaders and members led by the MCA State Chairman, Datuk Can Boon Leong - who did not 'carry the photograph of Liong Sik1 to establish his credential that he was personally representing Liong Sik - with only one sole aim, to create trouble.

I had urged the MCA Malacca national and state leaders at the start of last Saturday's 'Lim Kit Siang-Ling Liong Sik mutual questioning' to behave themselves and not to dishonour the good name of the Malaysian Chinese and the Malaysian people with any disorderly conduct and indiscipline, but this advice fell on deaf ears.

When the MCA President dare not attend the 'Lim Kit Siang-Ling Liong Sik mutual questioning" in "Malacca last Saturday after I had accepted his challenge, the MCA had actually forfeited all right to ask any more questions about the DAP Save Bukit China Fund.

However, as the DAP has nothing to hide on the DAP Save Bukit China Fund, I am prepared to arrange another 'Lim Kit Siang-Ling Liong Sik mutual questioning' in Malacca within a week if the MCA President dare to say publicly that he is not satisfied with the Save Bukit China One-Person One-Dollar Account.

This second 'Lim Kit Siang-Ling Liong Sik mutual questioning' would be held within a week once the MCA President dares to state publicly that he is not satisfied with my announcement of the details of the DAP Save Bukit China One-Person One-Dollar Fund.

In my letter to Liong Sik today, I also informed him of my allegation last Saturday that I have proof that he was personally involved in the conspiracy involving the Malacca Chief Minister, Tan Sri Rahim Tamby Cik and a group of MCA leaders ten years ago to demolish Bukit China.
I also informed Liang Sik that if there is a 'second Lim Kit Slang-Ling Liong Sik mutual questioning', I would produce such evidence and that I was giving him advance notice so that he could clear his name on his role in Rahim Tamby Cik's conspiracy ten years ago to demolish Bukit China.

In my letter to Liong Sik, I also enclosed my demand at the first 'Lim Kit Slang-Ling Liong Sik mutual questioning' that he gave a full explanation of his Bolton Finance scandal accounts and other MCA financial scandals, giving particulars of the explanations he need to give for each, such scandal, which are as follows:

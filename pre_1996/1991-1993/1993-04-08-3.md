# Samy Vellu should explain why prior notice of the extensive power disruptions yesterday as a result of TNB's nation-wide load-shedding exercise could not have been given to minimise losses, hardships and inconvenience.
 
The Minister for Energy, Telecommunications and Post, Datuk Seri G. Samy should explain why prior notice of the extensive power disruptions yesterday as .3. result Of Tenaga Nasional Bhd's nation-wide load-shedding exercise could -not have been given to mini¬mise losses, hardships and to industries, businesses and households.</u>

It is clear that the contingency measures which Tenaga Nasional Bhd. had devised to deal with the national energy crisis is not all that efficient and effective after all.

The privatisation of TNB has created a great problem as the Minister for Energy ,
Telecommunications and Posts seems to be 'washing his hands  of all responsibility for energy continued national energy crisis - by passing the whole buck to TN B .

This is most unsatisfactory, and the people must continue to hold the Minister for Energy, Telecommunications	and Posts personally	and directly responsible for every facet of national energy crisis, and to expect that he step forward to account people for every shortfall of performance of TNB

If the Minister for Energy, Telecommunications and Posts is allowed to disclaim responsibility for the national energy crisis, then Malaysia will be reaching a position when the people could hold nobody accountable for the maintenance of high standards 3f perform¬ance in essential services and utilities - which is definitely a step backwards for the country.

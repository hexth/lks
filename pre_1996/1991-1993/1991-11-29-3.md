# The people of Tanjung will tell the MCA leaders that their greatest concession in 42 –years will never be Supported, forgotten or forgiven by the Chinese voters

The MCA Youth has correctly chosen Tanjong constituency to start its opinion survey which it said would be held nation – wide, for I believe that the people of Tanjong will tell the MCA leaders that their greatest concession in 42 – years in renouncing and denying that Chinese primary schools have constitutional right, basis, status and guarantee will never be supported, forgotten or forgiven by the Chinese voters.</u>

I have confidence that the people of Tanjong speak up not only for themselves and their children, but the entire Malaysian people and the Chinese electorate, that they will stand firmly with the DAP to defend, protect and uphold the constitutional right, basis, status and guarantee of Chinese primary schools.

I also know that the outspoken and independent-minded voters of Tanjong will demand to know from MCA Youth leaders when they visit Tanjong an opinion survey why the present MCA leadership has made a concession which previous MCA leaderships under Tun Tan Siew Sin, Lee San Choon, Neo Yee Pan and even Tan Koon Swan had never done in the past 42 years.

Real purpose of MCA Youth survey is to declare that Chinese voters of Tanjong and the country support the new MCA stand that there is no constitutional right, status and protection for Chinese primary schools

The real purpose of the MCA Youth survey is obvious – they want to find an excuse to be able to declare that the Chinese voters in Tanjong as well as in other constitutencies throughout the country support the greatest MCA concession in 42 years that there is no constitutional right, status and protection for Chinese primary schools.

Let me tell the MCA Youth leaders that will not find any support, not only from Chinese voters of Tanjong, but also the Chinese voters throughout the country, for such a MCA concession.

On behalf of the Tanjong voters, I also want to give advance notice to the MCA youth leaders who are visiting Tanjong for the opinion questions:

Ten Questions the Voters of Tanjong will expect the MCA Youth leaders to answer in their opinion survey

1.	Why did the present MCA leadership make the greatest concession in 42 years to declare that there is no constitutional right, basis, status or guarantee for Chinese primary school;

2.	What moral and political right has the MCA leadership to make such a concession on the constitutional right of Chinese primary schools and mother-tongue education – without consultation or consent from the Malaysian Chinese?

3.	Did Section 6.15 of the MCA Constitution on its aims and objects authorise and empower the present MCA leadership to renounce and deny that Chinese primary schools and mother-tongue education enjoy constitutional status, protection and guarantee?

4.	Were the 530, 000 MCA members consulted and consent given before the MCA leadership made the greatest concession in 42 years?

5.	Will the other MCA leaders, delegates and members come forward to defend the constitutional right, status and protection of Chinese primary schools in their demand for an extraordinary general meeting of the MCA to amend Section 6.15 of the MCA Constitution to specify that one of its objects is “to defend, protect ad uphold the constitutional right, status and guarantee of Chinese primary schools and mother-tongue education”?

6.	Will the ordinary MCA members start a campaign among the 530, 000-member demanding that the present MCA leadership retract the concession and join forces with the DAP to defend, protect and uphold the constitutional right of Chinese primary schools and mother-tongue education.

7.	Is the MCA leadership trying to get the DAP to amend the DAP Constitution to incorporate Section 6.15 of the MCA Constitution, so that the DAP will also follow the MCA to renounce the constitutional right, status and guarantee of Chinese primary schools and mother-tongue education?

8.	Are the MCA leaders at national, state and branch levels aware of the grave long-term consequences to the future existence and development of Chinese primary schools and mother-tongue education with such a concession by the MCA leadership?

9.	Is the MCA leadership concession declaring that there is no constitutional right or protection for Chinese primary schools the recommendation of the professional consultants engaged by the MCA leadership after the October general elections last year to find out what the Chinese in Malaysia wanted and to recommend future policy directions for the MCA?

10.	What benefits did the MCA leaders get, whether in personal or party terms, for making this greatest concession of the MCA in its 42 years history?

I hope the MCA Youth would not get ‘cold feet’ and cancel its opinion survey in Tanjong and throughout the country.

# Law Hieng Deng should inform the Selangor Mentri Besar that Selangor State Exco should withhold final approval for the golf course and condominium project near Zoo Negara until approval by Department of Environment

The Minister for Science, Technology and Environment, Law Hieng Ding, should inform the Selangor Mentri Besar, Tan Sri Muhamad Haji Muhammad Taib, that the Selangor State Exco should withhold final approval for the golf course and condominium project near Zoo Negara until approval had been given by the Department of Environment (DOE).</u>

The Mentri Besar should also be told to vary its approval order given to the developers of the golf course and condominium project that whatever approval given by the Selangor State Exco is also provisional and not final, as it would be conditional on the approval by the DOE.

From the statements given by the Selangor Mentri Besar, it would appear that the Selangor State Exco does not recognize the existence of the DOE or even the nationâ€™s environmental laws, for otherwise, it would not have given full approval fro the golf course and condominium project without first seeking the approval of DOE.

I have been given to understand that there is substantial Japanese interest in the development of the golf course and condominium project near Zoo Negara.

The Selangor Mentri Besar should publicly divulge the identity, nature and percentage of Japanese interest in the golf course and condominium project, and in particular whether the Japanese represent majority interest in the project. The Selangor State Government should also reveal the Malaysian interest and party in the golf course and condominium project.

After the briefing of the Sultan of Selangor last Thursday, which angered rather than mollified the Sultan because of the intransigent stand of the Mentri Besar on the golf course and condominium project, Tan Sri Muhammad said the Selangor State Exco would review the matter at its next meeting on Wednesday.

The people hope that Tan Sri Muhammad would announce after the State Exco meeting on Wednesday that as the DOE had not considered the Environment Impact Assessment report of the project, and had not given its approval, the State Exco is suspending its approval of the golf course and condominium project until approval from the DOE.

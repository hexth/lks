# Abu Talib should explain why he has refused to give consent to the Securities Commission for the prosecutor of Union Paper shares scandal short sellers

The Attorney-General, Tan Sri Abu Talib Othman must explain why he has refused to give consent to the Securities Commission for the prosecution of Union Paper shares scandal short sellers.</u>

The reason he had given that he could not as yet grant this sanction pending the outcome of a prosecution already initiated against one of the persons named in the submission to the commission is not satisfactory, as it could tantamount to an obstruction to justice in having the effect as to stymie any prosecution of the Union Paper shares scandal short sellers

It is completely unacceptable, for instance, that the 12 short-sellers of the Union Paper shares scandal could not be prosecution because of one person against whom the Attorney-General had initiated action.

The investigating public are also entitled to know what the conditions which the Securities Commission had set out to the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange for the lifting of the suspension of the trading of Union Paper.

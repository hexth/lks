# Kit Siang faxes invitation to Liong Sik and Keng Yaik to jointly visit and meet Kelantan Menteri Besar on 28th January 1992 over the so-called 62 Islamistation measures of the Kelantan State Government in its first year in office.

I have today faxed invitations to the MCA President, Datuk Dr. Ling Liong Sik and the Gerakan President, Datuk Dr, Lim Kng Yaik, to join me in visiting and meeting the Kelantan Menteri Besar, Nik Abdul Nik Mat, on Tuesday, January 28, 1992 at 2.30 p.m. over the so-called 62 Islamisation measures’ of the PAS Kelantan State Government in its first 12 months in office.</u>

In my invitation faced separately to Liong Sik and Keng Yaik today, I said that I am extending an invitation to them because for the past few months, the MCA and Gerakan had said that the Chinese in Kelantan had been plunged into the great suffering of deep waters and furnace heat by 62 
Islamisation measures in the first 12 months of the Kelantan State Government.

In my fax, I said:” As a political leader, I am sure you would not want to miss any opportunity to rescue the Kelantan Chinese from such deep waters and furnace heat by taking up these so-called 62 Islamisation measures’ directly with the Kelantan Menteri Besar himself.”

I told Liong Sik and Keng Yaik in my faxed invitation that their refusal of the invitation could only mean one of two things: Firstly, that the MCA and Gerakan had been making wild and baseless allegations when the alleged that the Kelantan Chinese had been plunged into deep waters and furnace heat by 62 Islamisation measures in the first year of the Kelantan state government, and they dare not meet the Kelantan Menteri Besar face-to-face because when confronted, they will not be able to substantiate the MCA and Gerakan charges that the 62 Islamisation measures had deprived the Kelantan Chinese of their legitimate rights and interests;

Or secondly, although the MCA and Gerakan are right about the 62 Islamisation measures which had plunged the Kelantan Chinese into the great suffering of deep waters and furnace heat in the first 12 months of the Kelantan State Government, they have neither the conviction nor the courage to meet the Kelantan Menteri Besar face-to-face to tell him that the Kelantan State Government is wrong and must withdraw all the 62 Islamisation measures.

In my fax, I told Liong Sik and Keng Yaik that I would not be able to give them any help in the first situation if the MCA and Gerakan had made wild and baseless allegations that all the so-called 62 Islamisation measures had plunged the Kelantan Chinese into the great suffering of deep waters and furnace heat.

However, I gave Liong Sik and Keng Yaik my personal guarantee if it is the  latter situation, that the MCA and Gerakan are right of deep waters and furnace heat to the Kelantan Chinese, I undertook to stand solidly by them and even to be their spokesman in the meeting with the Kelantan Menteri Besar.

In my fax, I said :” In the interest of the political rights of all Malaysians, in particular the Chinese in Kelantan and Malaysia and the goal of a united and harmonious multi-racial, multi-lingual, multi-cultural and multi-religious Malaysia, I have extended this invitation to you to join in the visit to Kelantan and meet the Kelantan Menteri Besar, as well as proposing full backing and support to you if the MCA (Gerakan) is right that all the 62 Islamisation measures had plunged the Chinese in Kelantan into the great suffering of deep waters and furnace heat.

“I look forward to a positive response from you to this invitation which offers you a historic opportunity as well.”

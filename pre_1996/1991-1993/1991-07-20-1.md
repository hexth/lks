# CALL FOR ROYAL COMMISSION INTO THE TEN NEW FINANCIAL SCANDALS WHICH MARK THE LAUNCHING OF THE SIXTH MALAYSIA PLAN

WE, THE PEOPLE OF PRAI, AT THE DAP PRAI BY-ELECTION CERAMAH AT TAMAN KURAU, PRAI, RESOLVE TO MAKE THE FOLLOWING DECLARATION AS REPRESENTING OUR VIEWS AND ASPIRATIONS AND THOSE OF ALL OTHER LIKE-MINDED MALAYSIANS:</u>

EXPRESS SHOCK at the ten new financial scandals which mark the launching of the Second Outline Perspective Plan, the National Development Plan (1991-2000) and the Sixth Malaysia Plan as revealed by the Parliamentary Opposition Leader, DAP Secretary-General and MP for Tanjung, Lim Kit Siang, during his speech in Parliament on the Sixth Malaysia Plan on 10th July 1991:

EXPRESS GREATER SHOCK that the Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, had not been able to give convincing answers and rebuttals in his speech winding up the debate on the Sixth Malaysia Plan on 18th July 1991:

CALL FOR A ROYAL COMMISSION OF INQUIRY into the following ten new financial scandals raised in Parliament during the Sixth Malaysia Plan debate:

1.	The $71 million Masjid Tanah ammunition depot scandal, involving the Kedah Mentri Besar, Tan Sri Osman Aroff:

2.	The $100 million KOBENA scandal;

3.	The $260 million Bank Pertanian Scandal;

4.	The third Bank Bumiputra scandal in less than ten years, this time involving the $72 million BBMB Securities Sdn. Bhd. scandal;

5.	The six-bank ownership scandal;

6.	The Scandal of the new Finance Minister, Anwar Ibrahim, condoning and defending Daim Zainuddin in the UMBC illegal shares ownership scandal;

7.	The TENAGA NASIONAL BERHAD Scandal;

8.	The $189 million Kumpulan FIMA privatisation scandal;

9.	The Scandal of the $2 billion UEM Johore-Singapore Second Link and another $2 billion UEM contract to build a new Johore township;

10.	The Scandal of the UMNO Politics of Money, resulting in a situation described by MIC President, Datuk Samy Vellu, where: “If there is no political influence, even a company with a paid-up capital of as much as $200 million will not be able to make 20 cents”, and where a $2 company with political influence can easily make $200 million.

REAFFIRM our abhorrence of political, financial and moral scandals which have become very rampant under the New Economic Policy; and

REITERATE the utmost importance that the ten new financial scandals should be publicly investigated if the next ten years under the National Development Policy are not to see more and even worse political, financial and moral scandals than the past twenty years under the New Economic Policy.

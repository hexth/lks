# A Cabinet scandal of the first magnitude when Samy Vellu can publicly contradict Anwar Ibrahim’s statement in Parliament that the 10 million Telekom shares were allocated to MAIKA Holdings and not to MIC

It is a Cabinet scandal of the first magnitude when the MIC President and Minister of Energy, Telecommunications and Posts, Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu, can publicly contradict the Finance Minister, Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim’s statement in Parliament that the 10 million Telekom shares were allocated to MAIKA Holdings and not to MIC.</u>

Yesterday, Anwar Ibrahim said he was willing to co-operate with the Anti-Corruption Agency in its investigations into the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal involving Samy Vellu, and reiterated his statement in Parliament on the allocation of the 10 million Telekom shares to MAIKA.

Although Anwar Ibrahim said that it would be more appropriate to leave the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal to the ACA, as it is “in the final stage of its investigations”, the Cabinet cannot ignore the great Cabinet scandal of one minister publicly contradicting another minister’s parliamentary statement, especially when it concerns the public integrity and credibility of the government and its Ministers.

The Malaysian public, and in particular the MAIKA shareholders and the MIC membership, have a right to know from the Cabinet as to whether Anwar Ibrahim had told the truth in his statement in Parliament that the 10 million Telekom shares were allocated to MAIKA and not to MIC, or whether Samy Vellu is right in claiming that the 10 million Telekom shares were given to MIC.

If the Cabinet had allocated 10 million Telekom shares to MIC, then it should also list out the allocation of Telekom shares, as well as the shares of other privatised government corporations like Tenaga Nasional Bhd., to the various Barisan Nasional component parties.

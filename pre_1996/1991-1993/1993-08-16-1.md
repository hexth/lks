# DAP commends Morihiro Tokokawa for being the first Japanese Premier to express sympathy to victims of Japanese militarism

DAP commends Morihiro Tokokawa for being the first Japanese Premier to express sympathy to victims of Japanese militarism and to publicly admit that the Japannese war of aggressin during the Second World War as an “ an aggressive war and a wrong war”.</u>

Right from the beginning, DAP had given full support to the claims by the ‘sex slave’ victims of the Japanese Imperialist Army during the Second World War and had called on the Japanese Government to publicly apologise and pay compensation for the ‘comfort women’ brothers in Malaysia as well as in other Asian countries.

Since then, the Japanese Government has admitted the atrocities committed by the Japanese Imperialist Army against ‘sex slave’ victims in Malaysia and other countries during the second world war.

DAP calls on the Malaysian Government to set up a special unit to claim compensation from the Japanese Imperialist Army in Malaysia during the Japanese Occupation.

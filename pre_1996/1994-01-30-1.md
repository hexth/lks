# DAP calls on Finance Minister , Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim to order a public inquiry into the scandal of the distribution of the HICOM share application forms

DAP calls on the Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister , Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim , to order a public inquiry into the scandal of the distribution of the HICOM share application forms.</u>

The public inquiry should investigate as to how one million copies of the HICOM share application forms could be snapped up in the first day of the distribution , and identify the syndicates or persons involved.

There have been allegations that although the HICOM share application forms are issued free of charge , they were sold as much as for RM 300 each.

The Deputy Finance minister , Senator Mustapha Mohamed had publicly criticized ‘certain quarters for selling the share application forms at between RM30 and RM100 each.”

In view of still widespread complaints by the public that they could not get the HICOM shares have  the opportunity to do so , but also to break the syndicate which had hogged the HICOM share forms by making the HICOM forms freely available.

I hope Anwar Ibrahim could spare a little bit of time from the Sabah general elections campain to bring order and disciple into the distribution of the HICOM share application forms.

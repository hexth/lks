# Open reminder to Keng Yaik to be in Parliament tomorrow where I would repeat the words that he is ‘low-class and despicable’ politician so that he could institute legal proceedings against me 

This is an open reminder to the Gerakan President and Minister for Primary Industries Datuk Ben Dr. Lim Keng Yaik to be in Parliament at Conference Room I tomorrow where I would repeat the words that he is ‘low-clan and despicable’ politician so that he could institute defamation proceedings against me. </u>

Keng Yaik had said last week that he was considering legal action against me for uttering these word in tha newspaper report which he considered defamatory to his character and reputation. 

Tomorrow I will repeat these very words so that he could have no doubt whatsoever that I had clearly used these words against him. 

I welcome Keng Yaik to institute defamatory proceedings against me and he is welcome personally to Parliament House tomorrow, and he can bring his lawyers as well as his technical staff if he wants to tape-record or vided-tape the proceedings.

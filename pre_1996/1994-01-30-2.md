# DAP extends invitation to Keng Yaik to the Public Debate between DAP and Tsu Koon and Gim Hwa at the Penang Chinese Town Hall on Tuesday on the Hotel Metropole and Taman Midlands scandals

Gerakan President , Datuk seri Dr. Lim Keng Yaik said in Kuala Lumpur yesterday that he was satisfied with the explanation of the MPPP President , Datuk Tan Gim Hwa on the demolition of te Hotel Metropole in Penang .</u>

He said there was no impropriety of any kind in the sale of the building to Dolphin Square Sdn Bhd or its subsequent demolition.

It would appear that Datuk Tan Gim Hwa answers to Dr. Lim Keng Yaik and not to the Penang Chief Minister , Dr. Koh Tsu Koon on MPPP matters.If Keng Yaik declares that he satisf ied with the explanation of Tan Gim Hwa on the Hotel Metropole scandal , how dare Tsu Koon query Tan Gim Hwa on the matter?

This is a case where Keng Yaik had openly sided with Gim Hwa to undermine the authority of Tsu Koon as Chief Minister – but is this for the interest of Gerakan , of the interests oof people of Penang?

In any event, who is Keng Yaik to declare that he is satisfied with Gim Hwa ‘s  explanation of the Hotel Metropole scandal , when he is not even a rateplayer in Penang – while the overwhelming majority of the rateplayer of Penang are no satisfied with Gim Hwa ‘s explanation so far?

Since Keng Yaik has become the strongest champion of  Hwa in the Hotel metropole scandal , DAP extends our invitation to him to join the Public Debate which the DAP had challenged Tsu Koon and Gim Hwa over the Hotel metropole and Taman Midlands scandals at the Penang Chinese Town Hall on Tuesday , February 1.

Let Keng yaik tell the people of Penang on Tuesday night the reason s why he is satisfied with the explanations of Tan Gim Hwa on the Hotel Metropole scandal – although Gim Hwa had failed to answer the major questions which had been raised by the DAP in the past one month!

If Keng Yaik , Tsu Koon and Gim Hwa do not turn up for the public debate , the DAP leaders will explain to the people of Penang at the DAP ceramah at penang Chinese Town hall on Tuesday night why Keng Yaik has no good reason to be satisfied with Gim Hwa ‘s explanations on the Hotel metropole scandal.

I have instructed my lawyers , Karpal Sing & Co to file defamation suit against one Chinese newspaper in connection with its report of certain political party reactions which virtually accused me of having been bribed by Australian spies								

I have instructed my lawyers , Karpal Sing & Co to file defamation suit against one Chinese newspaper in connection with its report of certain political party reactions which virtually accused me of having been bribed by Australian spies	

Newspaper which published defamatory press statements by publicity bureaus or committees of political parties will have to take full responsibility for their actions . If they have to pay hefty damages for publishing such defamatory press statements , it is up to them to claim compensation from the political parties concerned – but this is a matter between them and the respective political parties which I do not want to be involved.

In this connection , I note that the Gerakan President Datuk Lim Keng Yaik , yesterday made very wild statements in his comments on the preposterous allegation by the Sdyney Sunday Telegraph that Australian spies had bribed Opposition politicians and Mps.

I will answer his wild allegations at the DAP Penang Ceramah at the Penang Chinese Hall Town on Tuesday , February 1 .

MCA greatly relieved if SAPP joins Barisan Nasional before Nomination DAY as MCA leaders know that if MCA fields candidates in Sabah the only question is whether they would all forfeit their deposits

MCA will be greatly relieved if SAPP join Barisan Nasional before Nomination Day as this will give them a good excuse for not fielding MCA candidates in the Sabah state general elections on February 18 and 19.

MCA leaders know that if MCA fields candidates in SABAH , the only question is whether the MCA candidates would all forfeit deposits – and not whether they could win or not.

It is impossible for MCA leaders to win the confidence of the Chinese in Sabah when they cannot win the confidence of the people in Peninsular Malaysia!

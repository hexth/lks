# DAP reiterates call for the requisitioning of emergency UN General Assembly to direct UN Secretary-General to use air power to relieve Sarajevo and the Muslim enclaves in Bosnia

The statement by the United States President , Bill Clinton , that the Western allies were unable to agree on whether to carry out air strikes in Bosnia , and that neither NATO allies nor the UN Secretary – General bputros Boutros-General backed the use of air power at this time is the latest example of the abysmal failure of international and moral leadership by the West and the United Nations.</u>

It is clear that the United states , NATO and the United Nations Secretary – General  cannot be relied upon to implement UN resolutions to use air power to relieve Sarajevo and the Muslim enclaves of Bosnia after 22 months of Bosinia Holocaust.

They could only make empty threats about air striked which are invariably detied by the Serbs or they would get embroiled in the question as to who could issue the command to launch air strikes which has led one field commander after another relinquishing command of the UN forces in Serbia in disgust.

The only option left is for an emergency UN General Assembly to override the UN Security Council and Boutros Bourtos – Ghali and direct the Secretary- General to order air strikes to silence the Serbian guns in bosnia-Herzegovina in accordance with UN resolutions.

The requisitioning of such an emergency UN General Assembly should take precedence and priority before the convening of any other international conferences on bosnia.

DAP supports the call of the International Conference of Parliamentarians which ended in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday for  a new international conference on the 22th month Bosnia conflict and the termination of the Geneva peace talks as the Geneva Conference mediators were neither accountable to the United Nations General Assembly nor the European Parliament.

Resuisitioning of emergency UN General Assembly should take priority over any new international conference on Bosnia- Herzegovina

Malaysian Foreign Minister , Datuk Abdullah Badawi , had said after the close of the International Conference of Parliamentarians that Wisma Putra was working on the structure of suc a new international conference and would present its proposals to the United Nations General Assembly when it is ready.

The tragedy is that many months will have to pass before the next UN General Assmbly is held , and in the meantime, more atrocities and carnage in Bosnia-Herzegovina would be perprtrated.

Can the world wait for so many months before the holding of the next United Nation General assembly while every day , more human lives are lost and more atrocities are perpetrated in Bosnia- Herzegovina ?

While working on a new international conference on Bosnia conflict conflict , priority must be given to the requisitioning of an emergency UN General Assembly to direct the UN Secretary – General to launch air strikes to silence Serbian Guns in Bosnia.

The Non- aliged Movement with membership of over 100 developing countries , which constitute the majority in the United Nations , should form the core group for such an international initiative to requisition for an emergency UN General Assembly.

It the United Nations General Assembly is incapable of ensuring that UN resolutions on Bosnia-Herzegovina are implemented what credibility is there for the convening of another international conference on Bosnia- Herzegovina .

# United Nation’s should accept the offer of 10,000 Iranian peace-keeping force in Bosnia-Herzegovina now that Russia has been allowed to send peacekeepers

The United Nations should accept the offer of 10,000 Iranian peace-keeping force in Bosnia-Herzegovina now that Russia has not only been allowed to send peace-keepers to former Yugoslavia, but to be deployed to Sarajevo.</u>

The Bosnian government is ‘ rightly skeptical about Russian neutrality and perturbed that the Russian presence in the Serb-held Sarajevo neighbourhood of Grbavica would, bolster the Serb cause.

The world community must be vigilant to ensure that the Russians peacekeepers are not allowed to become Serb partisans and protectors in Bosnia.

The United Nations decision to set a new deadline of March 7 for the re-opening of the Tuzia airport, for mercy flights is welcome. It is imperative however that the UN, NATO and the United States must go to the immediate relief of the Bosnian Muslims as otherwise, all other measures they could take in the future might be ‘too little, too late’ to save further lives from being transformed into lengthening death statistics of the Bosni¬an Holocaust.

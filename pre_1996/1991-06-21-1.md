# Lim Hock Seng asked by DAP leadership to explain allegations by Penang Barisan Nasional component parties that he had abused his position as elected representative for his own direct pecuniary interest

DAP Mp for Began and Assemblyman for Mak Mandin, Sdr.Lim Hock Seng, has been asked by the DAP leadership to explain allegations by Penang Barisan Nasional and component partiesin the past few days  that he had abused his position as elected representative for his own direct pecuniary interest.</u>

Penang UMNO State Secretary, Dr.Ibrahim Saad, first made this allegation in the Penang Assembly on Tuesday when Sdr.Lim Hock Seng moved a motion urging the State Government to help legalise and regularise the illegal factories in the state which do not cause environmental pollution or pose a danger to nearby residents.

The opening salvo by the Penang UMNO State leader had been taken by the Penang Gerakan and Penang MCA, including the demand that Sdr.Lim Hock Seng should resign as elected representative for having betrayed the trust of his electorate.

The DAP leadership takes these allegations by the Penang Barisan NAsional component parties, headed by the Penang UMNO State Secretary, Dr.Ibrahim Saad, seriously, and Sdr.Lim Hock Seng has been called up to explain the allegations made against him.

The DAP leadership will not hesitate to take actions against any DAP MP or Assemblyman, including asking for their resignation, if this is necessary to protect the interests of the people and the Party.

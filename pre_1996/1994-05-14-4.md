# The whole country grieves the loss of a second Malaysian son in Bosnia-Herzegovina - Mejar Ariffin Zakaria

The whole country grieves the loss of a second Malaysian son in Bosnia-Herzegovina - Mejar Ariffin Zakaria who was killed on Thursday after coming under mortar fire in the Illijas area, 25 km from Visoko, northwest of Sarajevo.</u>

The first Malaysian casualty in Bosnia-Herzegovina was Mejar Ramli Shaari, who was killed three weeks ago by an anti¬-personnel mine in Croatia.

There can be no greater service to the country than that of Mejar Ariffin Zakaria, who has given his life in the cause of justice and humanity - and the country must remember Mejar Ariffin Zakaria’s great sacrifice by looking after the welfare of his family and children.

After the death of Mejar Ramli Shaari, the Cabinet directed the Ministry of Defenceto review measures to enhance the protection and safety of the 1,500 Malaysian UN peace-keepers in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

The Ministry of Defence owes the whole nation a full explanation as to the outcome of such review to give better protection to the safety and lives of Malaysian personnel in Yugoslavia.

Although the risks to limb and life must be accepted by all the 1,500 Malaysians serving as UN peacekeepers in ex-Yugoslavia as an inescapable hurt of their duty, the Ministry of Defence must satisfy the nation that it is taking all possible measures to minimise such risks.

# Strong protest to Nik Aziz against breach of undertaking to maintain the status quo on the regulation affecting non-Muslins on public sale and consumption of alcohol and not to infringe rights of non-Muslims

I have sent a strong protest to Kelantan Mentri Besar, Nik Aziz Nik Mat, against his breach of undertaking to DAP leaders at our meeting in January 1992 to maintain the status quo on the regulation affecting non-Muslins on public sale and consumption of alcohol and that the rights of the non-Muslims in Kelantan would not be infringed.</u>

The new regulations announced yesterday on public sale and consumption of alcohol affecting non-Muslims which is to come into effect on July 1 is completely unsatisfactory and unacceptable.

Nik Aziz should honour the solemn undertaking to maintain the status quo on the regulation concerning public sale and consumption of alcohol affecting non-Muslins and not to infringe non-Muslims rights. The Kelantan State Government should also fully respect the multi-racial and multi-religious sensitivities in the country by reverting to the status quo on the public sale and consumption of alcohol affecting non-Muslims in Kelantan.

# Call on ASEAN and the international community to consider sanctions against Myanmar military junta if it defies world opinion and continues with its brutal human rights abuses

ASEAN and the international community should consider sanctions against the Myanmar military junta if it continues to defy world opinion and persists in its brutal human rights abuses.</u>

The Myanmar military junta must be condemned by the international community if it refuses to allow the United Nations human rights mission, headed by Japanese university professor Yozo Yokota currently in Myanmar, access to Nobel Peace Price recipient, Aung Sun Suu Kyi and other detained dissidents.

DAP calls on the Malaysian Government to co-sponsor a resolution in the UN General Assembly against the Myanmar military junta for brutal human rights abuses

If the Myanmar military regime continues to disregard international calls for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners, and allowing the Nobel Peace Price winner to exercise her mandate won in the May 1990 Myanmar general elections to form a democratic government, Malaysia must play a leading role in the United Nations and international forums against human rights abuses in Myanmar.

DAP calls on the Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, who had expressed support for democracy and good government in the Harare CHOGM to make Myanmar a kajor foreign policy issue for Malaysia, and not only to support a resolution in the forthcoming United Nations General Assembly against the Myanmar military junta, but to offer to co-sponsor such a resolution as well.

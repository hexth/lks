# Selangor Mentri Besar should not adopt a confrontational stand and should seek an audience with the Sultan of Selangor to resolve differences

The Selangor Mentri Besar, Tan Sri Muhammad Haji Muhammad Taib, had clearly acted prematurely in taking a public confrontational stand against the Sultan of Selangor on the issue of the Selangor State honours.</u>

The Selangor Menteri Besar should be advised not to adopt a confrontational stand and should seek an audience with the Sultan of Selangor to resolve differences, instead of trying to politicise the issue of the Selangor State honours.

Two days ago, the Sultan of Selangor clarified as untrue allegations made at the recent UMNO General Assembly that the repairs to the Istana Alam Shah in Klang had used financial provisions for mosques and religious schools.

The Sultan said that the repairs to the Istana Alam Shah in Klang were made under the provisions of the Jabatan Kerja Raya.

The important question is why this clarification was not made by the Selangor Mentri Besar, Tan Sri Muhammad Haji Muhammad Taib, as head of the Selangor state government. On the contrary, the Selangor Mentri Besar had allowed this unfounded allegation against the Sultan of Selangor to be spread for over three months that the repairs to the Istana Alam Shah in Klang was made at the expense of $11 million provisions for mosques and religious schools.

The Selangor Mentri Besar owes to the people of Selangor and Malaysia a full explanation, for the worsening of relations between the Palace and the State Government is a matter of concern, not only to Selangor, but to the whole country.

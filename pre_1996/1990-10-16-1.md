# DAP welcomes PBS decision to quit Barisan Nasional

DAP welcomes the decision of the PBS to quit the Barisan Nasional and delaring support for the general elections manifesto released by Semangat 46 President, Tengku azaleigh Hamzah, on behalf of GAGASAN RAKYAT, comprising Semangat 46, DAP, IPF, Parti Rakyat Malaysia and MSP.</u>

The announcement by the PBS President, Datuk Joseph Pairin Kitingan, last night to withdraw from the Barisan Nasional would give an added boost to the nation-wide demand for change in the general elections.

The DAP is prepared to work and co-operate with PBS in Sabah to ensure that the historic and unprecedented opportunity of the people of Malaysia for great political change in this general election is fully realized.

In the formulation of the GAGASAN RAKYAT manifesto, the views of Sabah DAP and Sarawak DAP were taken fully in account, which explains the clear enunciation in the manifesto on the restoration of the rights and privileges promised to the people of Sabah and Sarawak, and by reviewing federal-state relations, e.g. financial arrangements, including all royalties, and the status of Labuan.

DAP welcomes PBS to join the Sarawak together with Semangat 46 President, Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, on Thursday as part of the nation-wide general elections tour.

# All-Party Parliamentary Committee, on Parliamentary Honour and National-Integrity will, have its first meeting after the Chinese New Year holidays and will seek meetings with the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and the Inspector-General of Police

The All-Party Parliamentary Committee on Parliamentary Honour and National Integrity will have its first meeting after the Chinese New Year holidays and will seek meetings with the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime -Minister and the Inspector-General of Police.</u>

I had invited the Inspector-General of Police, Tan Sri Rahim Mohamed Noor, to attend the meeting of MP's at Parliament, House yesterday which set up the All-Party Parliamentary Committee on Parliamentary Honour and National Integrity to ask him to give a special briefing to MPs about his statement that prelimi¬nary police investigations had found some evidence to back up the allegations in the Australian mass media that Malaysian MPs and politicians had been bribed by Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) agents.

Before the meeting yesterday, Tan Sri Rahim sent a message that he was unable to attend the meeting of MPs at Parliament House because of a prior engagement.

MPs irrespective of party must take very serious note of Tan Sri Rahim's statement that preliminary police investiga¬tions had found some evidence to back up allegations that Malaysian MPs and politicians had been bribed by Australian spies, as this has further tarnished the honour and credibility of the Malaysian Parliament.

The All-Party Parliamentary Committee on Parliamentary Honour and National Integrity would like to meet the IGP at the earliest possible date to satisfy itself that the IGP had real basis for making his statement.

If what Tan Sri Rahim said is true, then he should submit such preliminary evidence to Parliament, because apart from a police case, this is a matter which also affects parliamentary privileges.

An MP who received bribes from a foreign secret intel¬ligence service has not only committed the crime of treason but also violated his oath of office as a Member of Parliament,

Such an MP should be expelled from Parliament to clear the name, honour and credibility of Parliament.

Cabinet should convene emergency Parliamentary meeting on the Australian allegations in February itself.

In view of the gravity and urgency of the MPs bribery allegations, the Cabinet should convene an emergency Parliamen¬tary meeting in February itself.

The All-Party Parliamentary Committee on Parliamentary Honour and National Integrity, which was formed by 20 MPs from DAP and seven MPs from Semangat 46, will invite all other political parties represented in Parliament to nominate their representatives to serve on the Committee - such as UMNO, MCA, Gerakan, MIC, SUPP, PBB, SNAP, PBDS, PAS and PBS.

Let MPs from all political parties rise above their political differences and show to the country and the world that they could act as one patriotic parliamentary unit on matters affecting the honour of Parliament and the integrity of Malaysia,

The scope of the All-Party parliamentary Committee on Parliamentary Honour and National Integrity will not be confined to the Australian bribery allegations of MPs, but will scrutinise all foreign mass media reports which tarnish the honour of the Malaysian Parliament and the integrity of the nation - whether these reports are from Australia, United Kingdom, the United States or any other foreign country.

# Liong Sik is only strengthening suspicion that something is very wrong with the MCA donation campaign when he resurrects the DAP Save Bukit China One-Person One-Dollar Account to try to stop DAP’s query about donations which MCA is collecting in the name of Chinese Independent Secondary Schools

MCA President, Datuk Dr. Ling Liong Sik is only strengthening suspicion that something is very wrong with the MCA donation campaign when he resurrects the DAP Save Bukit China One-person One-Dollar account to try to stop DAP’s query about donations which the MCA is collecting in the name of Chinese Independent Secondary Schools.</u>

From his speeches and statements in Penang, Ipoh and Kuala Lumpur in the past three days, the people are asking why Liong Sik is acting so irrationally and even hysterically when I asked him to account to the Chinese community for three items of donations which the MCA is collecting from the Chinese community making use of the name of Chinese Independent Secondary Schools, namely:

* Firstly, the RM3,188,888.88 which the Liong Sik announced at the MCA nation-wide donation launching-off ceremony in Seremban on May 27 as having been collected;

* Secondly, the RM6 million from the 600,000 MCA members on the basis of RM10 per member, which Liong Sik would be collected by the end of the year; and

* Thirdly, the collection from the big donors in the Chinese community, making use of the tax-exempt status of Huaren Fund account, in the nine months from May to January next year before all the monies from the account are handed over to the 60 Chinese Independent Secondary Schools, which should exceed RM30 million.

First of al, doesn’t Liong Sik agree that the MCA should account to the Chinese community for the three items of donations which the MCA is collecting from the Chinese community in the name of Chinese Independent Secondary Schools?

Liong Sik has lost the right to raise questions about the DAP Save Bukit China One-Person One-Dollar Account as he dared not keep the Bukit China appointment on July 10 last year

Or dare Liong Sik claim that the MCA is not responsible or accountable to the Chinese community on Items One and Three, and is only responsible for the RM6 million it is raising from 600,000 MCA members on the basis of RM10 a member?

Liong Sik should know that his attempts to stop the DAP from raising questions about the three items of MCA donations collected from the Chinese community using the name of Chinese Independent Secondary Schools are weak and ineffective.

In fact, it is Liong Sik who has lost the right to raise questions about the DAP Save Bukit China One-Person One-Dollar Account as he dared not keep the Bukit China appointment on July 10 last year when I accepted his challenge to produce the DAP Save Bukit China One-Person One-Dollar Account.

Liong Sik dared not show up although the MCA Malacca State Chairman, Gan Boon Leong, gatecrashed at the function.

However, when I asked Gan Boon Leong whether he had the authorization from Liong Sik to represent the MCA President, such as producing Liong Sik’s photograph (which Boon Leong had saved in a Malacca MCA fire), Boon Leong was dumb-founded and just sat down!

The DAP has nothing to hide on the DAP Save Bukit China One-Person One-Dollar account and this was why as far back as 15th February 1985, the DAP had publicly announced details of the account when the DAP succeeded in our nation-wide Save Bukit China campaign.

Liong Sik should explain why he is the Minister who has played the most truant from his parliamentary duties

Liong Sik has not answered my expose at the Malacca and Rasah dinners last weekend that he is the Minister who has played the most truant from his parliamentary duties.

Out of 272 days of parliamentary sittings since the 1990 general elections, Liong Sik has attended only 24 days – mostly formal functionsl like the official opening of Parliament by the Yang di Pertuan Agong, budget speeches by the Finance Minister, Constitution Amendment Bill votings and when the Prime Minister tabled motions in Parliament.

Can Liong Sik answer how many times he had gone to Parliament during question time to answer questions since he became Cabinet Minister in 1986, and why he is the Minister who has played the most truant from his parliamentary duties?

Is Liong Sik prepared to be humble and honest and admit that he had been playing the most truant from his parliamentary duties, and that henceforth, he would be more responsible and follow the example of other Cabinet Ministers, including the Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, the Deputy Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim, MIC President, Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu and the Gerakan President, Datuk Dr. Lim Keng Yaik to answer questions in Parliament personally himself?

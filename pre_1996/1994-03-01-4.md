# United Nations should launch air strikes to silence Serb guns to relieve Tuzla which has become the target of heavy Serb bombardment after the downing of four Serb planes by NATO

The United Nations should launch air strikes to silence Serb guns to relieve Tuzla in Bosnia-Herzegovina which has become the target of heavy Serb bombardment after the downing of four Serb planes by NATO.</u>

Tuzla was one of the Muslim enclaves which the United Nations had declared as a ‘safe area’, but which had continued to be unsafe because of the siege by Serb guns and forces.

The Serb violation of the United Nations ‘no-fly zone’ in Bosnia imposed since April last year by Serb attack aircrafts is a Serb declaration to the world community that it has no intention to take part in any peace process in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that only international force can compel the Bosnian Serbs to disgorge the territories it had illegally annexed from Bosnia.

The violation of the 11-month UN ‘no-fly zone’ by Serb attack aircrafts should be another eye-opener to the international community that the Serbs cannot be trusted to end its grand design to create a Greater Serbia out of the genocide and ethnic cleansing of the Bosnian Muslims.

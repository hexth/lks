_The DAP Organising Secretary, Mr. Lim Kit Siang, today issued the following statement (16.3.1969):_

I must commend Inche Harun bin Hashim, the Director of Anti-Corruption Agency, for the speed with which he completed his investigations as to whether Mr. Khaw Khai Boh was a director of Metalex (M) Co. when he was minister without Portfolio.

An hour after my press conference yesterday, Inche Harun had already investigated into the matter and found my allegation ‘unfounded.’

But both Inche Harun bin Hashim and Mr. Khaw Khai Boh did not explain why the annual returns of Metalex (M) Co. Filed with the Registry of Companies in 1965 still showed Mr. Khaw Khai Boh as one of the directors, when Mr. Khaw had resigned in March 1963 before assuming Ministerial office.

This clearly calls for an explanation.

# MPPP should check whether the new MBF building at Jalan Sultan Ahmad shah is tilting

The MPPP should check whether the new MBF building at Jalan Sultan Ahmad Shah is tilting and that work for the installation of lifts for the high-rise building has been suspended. As a result , the operation of the MBF office which has authority from Bank Negara to start on 8th December 1993 had been postponed. </u>

The MBF building is constructed on the site of the previous Northam Court Building builit by United Engineers which had to be demolished because it was tilting dangerously.

The MPPP must assure the people of Penang that the new MBF building at Jalan Sultan Ahmad shah is safe.

# Call on the two MCA EXCO Members, Datuk Tee Cheng York and Datuk Lim Soo Kiang, to turn up at Bukit China on July 8, to explain to their stand on the levelling and development of Bukit China Malacca

In the whole Bukit China affair, ever since the State Government communicated to the Chang Hoon Teng Temple, the Bukit China trustees, of its intention to level and develop Bukit China last October, the confirmation of  by the Chief Minister, Datuk Abdul Rahim Thamby Cik, in the State Assembly in April of the Government’s plan to level and develop Bukit China, the reiteration by the Chief Minister last month to proceed with its plan as originally intended for Bukit China, the two MCA EXCO Members, Datuk Tee Cheng York and Datuk Lim Soo Kiang have been strangely and unusually quiet about the Bukit China issue.</u>

Both Datuk Tee and Datuk Lim continued with their ‘policy of silence’ even when two weeks ago, the State Government took a further step to achieve its plan to level and develop Bukit China, by slapping a $2 million demand for quit rent and late payments fine for the last 16 years on Bukit China.

Both Datuk Tee and Datuk Lim cannot be silent any more, or pretend not to see, hear or know anything about the State Government’s plan to level and develop Bukit China.

It is pathetic that they even dare not call up the Malacca District Officer to demand an Explanation why he is picking on Bukit China and discriminating against the 500-year-old historic, religious and cultural symbol not only for Malacca Chinese, but part of Malaysian national heritage, when other cemeteries have not be required to pay quit rent in the last 16 years.

Both Datuk Tee and Datuk Lim must realise that they are-part of EXCO, and unless they dissociate themselves from the $2 million quit rent demand on Bukit China, they must be held responsible as part of the men responsible in seeking to extract $2 million from the Chinese community with regard to Bukit China, which is a trust property for the Chinese community for religious purposes.

I call on Datuk Tee and Datuk Lim to turn up at Bukit China on July 8, 1984, Sunday, to explain to the people of Malacca why they supported the plan for State Government levelling and development of Bukit China, and even worse, the $2 million quit rent demand on Bukit China. The people of Malacca should gather in large numbers to hear their explanation, and demonstrate their protest.

I hope that both Datuk Tee and Datuk Lim, elected by the people, have not reached the stage where they are afraid to face the people to explain and justify their actions decisions in the Malacca State Exco.

Is levelling of Bukit China intended for the 80-acre land reclamation project of United Estates Projects

In May, it was announced that the State Exco had decided to allow United Estate Projects (UEP) to reclaim 80 acres of  land from the sea, and that the reclamation work is expected to be finished within two years, the first phase of the UEP reclamation is expected to begin in June, would consist of 426 units of shop houses, stalls and 10-storey medium-cost flats.

What the Malacca people want to know is whether the UEP 80-acre land reclamation project is supposed to get its earth from the levelling of  Bukit China according to the Sate Government Plan, for if it is so, then time is very short to save Bukit China.

I call on Datuk Tee and Datuk Lim to clarify this matter in the public interest, without any delay.

# DAP calls for immediate government recognition of Nantah and Formosan degrees and qualifications without any more delay

The ministry of Education announced two days ago government recognition of degrees of eight universities in Indonesia.

What many people cannot understand is why the government has taken so long to decide on the question of recognition of degrees and qualifications of Nantah and Formosan universities.</u>

About 8,000 Malaysian students are graduates from Nantah and Formosan universities and colleges, and they represent a reservoir of skilled manpower which is very scarce in Malaysia for her modernization needs.

Instead of according recognition to holders of Nantah and Formosan universities degrees, which are of international repute, and giving these university graduates their rightful place in society, the Malaysian Government has treated them as outcasts, rejects and useless elements.

The question of the recognition of Nantah and Formosan degrees and qualifications has been an outstanding problem for over a decade, and the government should immediately accord recognition to these qualifications without any more delay.

The theme of this year’s National Day is ‘just society’. Let the government give justice to the Malaysians who hold degrees of Nantah and Formosan universities.

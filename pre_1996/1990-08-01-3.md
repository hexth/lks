# Kit Siang to ask for Home Ministry approval to visit the three Sabahans detained at Kamunting Detention Centre

The three Sabahans detained in May by Police for allegedly being involved in a plot to take Sabah out of Malaysia have been served with formal two-year detention orders under the Internal Security Act and are now detained at the Kamunting Detention Centre.

Madam Janny Ambang and her mother visited her husband, Sabah Air chairman, Benedict Topin, while Judith Chin met her husband, Albinus Yudah in Kamunting yesterday.</u>

I have said that if the three Sabahans are involved in a plot to take Sabah out of Malaysia, then they should be charged in court and given a chance to defend themselves. The use of the ISA to detain them without trial and without having to prove the police case is not a flattering commentary on the Malaysian Police.

I will write to the Home Ministry in my capacity as Parliamentary Opposition Leader for approval to meet the three Sabahans in the Kamunting Detention Centre.

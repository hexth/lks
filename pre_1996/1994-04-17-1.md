# DAP calls on Cabinet to appoint a Special Prosecutor to take over all investigations involving the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal from the ACA and the Police with powers to prosecute all offences that have been committed

I welcome the denial yesterday by the Anti-Corruption Agency Director-General, Tan Sri Zulkifli Mahmood that the ACA had stopped its investigations into MIC President and Minister for Energy, Telekom shares hijacking scandal from the ACA and the Police with full powers to prosecute all offences that have been committed</u>

I welcome the denial yesterday by the Anti-Corruption Agency Director-General, Tan Sri Zulkifli Mahmood that the ACA had stopped its investigations into MIC President and Minister for Energy, Telecommunications and Posts, Datuk Seri S.Samy Vellu and the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal as reported by a local press on Thursday.

Tan Sri Zulkifli said he had been wrongly quoted as saying that the ACA had ‘completely ended investigations’ into the MAIKA Telekom shares hjacking scandal and that he had asked for a correction in the local press concerned.

Tan Sri Zulkifli said that “the matter was still being investigated by the police”.
 
Although Tan Sri Zulkifli denied that the ACA had stopped its investigations into the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal, his statement that “the matter was still being investigated by the police” raises the question whether the ACA is actively investigating the case, or has passed the matter to the Police.

Two years have passed since I first raised the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal and Samy Vellu’s role in it in Parliament, and I must express ny great disappointment at both the ACA and the Police for their failure to uphold the law in the country.

Since I raised the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal in Parliament, several new crimes had been committed, including:

•	The assault of MAIKA shareholders peacefully picketing outside MAIKA headquarters on May 13, 1992. The MIC Selangor Assemblyman for Seri Cahaya, S.Sivalingam, led the assault in the full view of the police

•	The burglary and ransacking of the MAIKA headquarters in Kuala Lumpur on 24th May 1992, which had been described by the police as “an inside job… to ransack cabinets belonging to MAIKA Holdings and its subsidiaries”

•	the disruption of a DAP MAIKA ceramah in Port Klang on May 13,1992 by some one hindred MIC supporters led by Selangor MIC Assemblyman, S.Sellathevan, MIC Senator Krishnan and the late Datuk T.M. Thurai, then MIC Selangor State Excomembers;

•	the assault of a Perak DAP State Committee member by Sungai Siput MIC local leaders on June 15, 1992 in connection with a DAP MAIKA ceramah again in the presence of the police: and

•	the fabrication of Telekom shares accounts by Samy Vellu to frustrate and obstruct ACA investigations into the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal as publicly confessed by a person who was involved in the fabrication of documents, V. Subramaniam.

Both the ACA AND THE Police have proved that they are not to their job in upholding the law as the various crimes which had been connected with the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal and its expose in the last two years, as no prosecution had been initiated at all.

DAP calls on the Cabinet to appoint a Special Prosecutor to take over all investigations into the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal and all matters related to it from the ACA and the Police, with full powers to prosecute all offences which had been committed – whether against corruption laws or other criminal laws.

The Cabinet should give full mandate to the Special Prosecutor to arrest and prosecute all those who had committed offences in the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal regardless of rank or position without having to get any ‘green light’ from the political leadership in Government.

Challenge to Samy Vellu to reply in Parliament to the new evidence which I had produced implicating him in the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal

As a result of the fresh evidence which I had produced in Parliament on Wednesday implicating Samy Vellu in the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal, Samy Vellu has lost further credibility among Barisan Nasional Ministers and MPs, especially after his failure to give a personal explanation in Parliament to clear himself.

Even MIC leaders and members throughout the country are beginning to ask question and this is why Samy Vellu is going round the various states to meet MIC State and branch leaders to allay their doubts.

I challenge Samy Vellu to reply in Parliament to the new evidence which I had produced implicating him in the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal.

Samy Vellu said in Malacca that he had valid explanations for all transactions in his bank account, including the alleged RM38 million banked into his personal account from the proceeds of sale of the Telekom shares.

If this is the case, then let Samy Vellu stand up in Parliament to give his ‘valid explanations’ about why the RM38 million from the proceeds of the sale of the Telekom shares had been banked into his personal account, and to state where are these RM38 million now!

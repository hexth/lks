# DAP CEC decides that the party withdraws from Gagasan Rakyat

The DAP Central Executive Committee at its meeting in Petaling Jaya headquarters last night decided that the DAP withdraw from the Gagasan Rakyat.</u>

I have informed the Gagasan Rakyat Chairman, Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah of the decision of the DAP CEC.

Although the DAP has withdrawn from Gagasan Rakyat, DAP will continue to maintain bilateral relations with Parti Melayu Semangat 46, Parti Rakyat Malaysia and the other component members of Gagasan Rakyat.

The DAP’s position vis-a-vis PAS is unchanged. The DAP had not and will not have any links or relationship with PAS, which had never been a member of Gagasan Rakyat, despite MCA and Gerakan lies that the DAP had co-operated with PAS and supported PAS’ hukum hunud and other Islamisation policies.

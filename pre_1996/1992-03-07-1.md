# DAP welcomes the call by Denq Xiaoping to all exiled Chinese dissidents to return to China to help in reforms with promise of no reprisals.

It has been reported that in his first major speech to be distributed to Communist Party members for more than two years, Deng Xiaoping urged those exiled Chinese, “no matter what their political views and what else they have expressed in the past”, to return to China and promised reprisals.</u>

Deng says the contributions that Chinese dissidents who have lived could make to his economic reforms intended to replace rigid planning with a market-oriented system.

He promised that jobs would be found for all those returned and they would be given appropriate welfare care, as only those exiles who return  to Chinawould they be able to make the most of their abilities.

DAP hopes that Deng Xiaoping’s speech marked a new policy shift by the Chinese Government showing greater respect for human rights in China.

DAP calls on Deng Xiaoping to accompany his call to Chinese dissidents to return to China to help in the reforms in China with the release of all students, dissident intellectuals, workers and others who have been, detained and jailed after the crushing of the pro-democracy Tiananmen demonstrations in 
June 1989.

# Call on former Finance Minister and currently UMNO Treasurer, Daim Zainuddin , to explain his relationship with the Sungai Buloh firecracks factory whose explosions last Tuesday killed or injured 100 people.

Former Finance Minister and currently UMNO Treasurer, Daim Zainuddin, should explain his relationship, past and present, with the Sungai Buloh fireworks factory, Bright Sparklers, whose explosion on Tuesday killed or injured 100 people and destroyed numerous houses in Sungai Buloh new village.</u>

Daim Zainuddin should clarify what relationship he had with the fireworks factory, whether he was its first promoter and one of such shareholdings; and if he had divested his shareholdings, when such divestment took place; and what relationship he maintained with the company all these years.

If Daim Zainuddin had no connection whatsoever with the Sungai Buloh fireworks factory, then he should publicly declare so.

This is a matter of great public interest, and Daim Zainuddin cannot continue to keep ‘diam’.

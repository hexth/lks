# Tsu Koon and Gim Hwa can use the Public Debate with DAP on February 1 to raise the Kelantan Syariah Criminal (NO2) Enactment it they really believe that DAP is responsible for it 

The DAP has offered to convert our ceramah at the Penang Chinese Town Hall next Tuesday on February 1 into a Public Debate with Dr. Koh Tsu Koon and Tan Gim Hwa on the Hotel Metropole and the Taman Midlands ;one-stop centre’ scandals since Gerakan leaders have claimed that the DAP had been telling lies on both scandals.</u>

It is up to Tsu Koon and Gim Hwa to decide whether the political event at the Penang Chinese Town Hall on February 1 is going to be a Public Debate with the DAP on the Hotel Metropole and Taman Midlands scandals , or whether it is going to be a Penang DAP Ceramah on these two scandals and the latest political situation in the state and country.

Tsu Koon and Gim Hwa can use the Public Debate with DAP on February 1 to raise the Kelantan Syariah Criminal (no 2 ) Enactment it the Gerakan leaders really believe that the DAP is responsible for it.

The DAP stand on the Kelantan Syariah Criminal (No2) Enactment in very clear , as we have publicy made clear our opposition on the ground that hokum hudud laws are inappropriate and imcompatible to a multi – religious society based on a secular Constitution.

It is for this reason that the DAP objects to various measures taken and proposed in Kelantan , as in the recent refusal by the Kota Bahru Municipal Council to allow supermarkets to sell beer or the separation of men and women in cinema halls.

The Koon will have to detend the Gerakan stand on the Penang Administration Islamic Religious Affairs Enactment 1993 at the Public Debate with DAP at Penang Chinese Town Hall on February 1  

To fairness to Tsu Koon , I must also give him advance notice that although he and Gim Hwa could use the Public Debate to raise Kelantan Syariah Criminal (no 2 ) Enactment , he would have to detend the Gerakan stand on the Penang Administration Islamic Religious Affairs Enactment 1993.

This Enactment , which was possed by the Penang State Assembly despite the strong objections at the DAP Penang Assemblymen , provided that where a father or mother embraces Islam, he or she could decide that the child under his or he custody should be converted to Islam – in utter disregard of the wishes of other parent of the child itself.

This is a major deprivation of the existing rights of non-Muslim Malaysians , and it is most shocking that the Gerakan Chief Minister and State Executive Councillors could support such an Islamic enactment in Penang State.

Let Gim Hwa tell the people at Penang at the Public Debate on February 1 as to how much he sold for his shares in Hotel Metropole 

Although Tsu Koon and Gim Hwa could raise the Kelantan hokum hudud enactment and other issues , they should realize the central focus of the public Debate with the DAP will be on the Hotel Metropole and Taman Midlands scandals , and they should be prepared to give a full and satisfactory accounting on both scandals.

For example , let Gim Hwa tell the people of Penang at the Public Debate on February 1 as to how much he sold for his shares in Hotel Metropole after he became MPPP President.

The people of Penang are also entitled to know the actual relationship between the Gerakan leaders – both Penang and national – and the true owners of the RM 2 company , Dolphin Square Sdn Bhd who paid RM 9.5 million for Hotel Metropole .

It is very signiticant that up to now , both Tsu Koon and Gim Hwa are not prepared to actknowledge that they know who are the real owners of Dolphin Square Sdn Bhd . Are Tsu Koon and Gim Hwa suggesting that they do not know the identities of the real owners at Dolphin Square Sdn Bhd or that they are strangers altogether?

# DAP moves motion in Parliament to commend the Police and Prison authorities for their rescue of the two hostages in Prison Prisons without firing a shot

The DAP commends the Police and Prisons authorities for their conduct in the six-day hostage crisis in the Pudu Prisons, freeing Dr. Radzi bin Jaafar and laboratory technologist Abdul Aziz Abdul Majid, by six prisoners without firing a shot.</u>

I have given notice to the Speaker, Tan Sri Mohamad Zahir Ismail, that the House, on behalf of the nation adopt a motion to record its appreciation and commendation of the Police and Prisons authorities for their patience and exemplary conduct throughout the six-day ordeal, giving priority to the saving of lives.

I hope the Government will agree to give this motion priority so that Parliament could publicity commend the Police and Prisons authorities for the exemplary manner they handled themselves in the six-day hostage crisis.

My motion reads:

“That this House, on behalf of the people and nation, records its appreciation and commendation of the Police and Prison authorities for their exemplary handling of the six-day hostage crisis in the Pudu Prisons, giving priority to the saving of lives, in particular the two hostages, Dr. Radzi bin Jaafar and laboratory technologist Abdul Aziz Abdul Majid, and their success in ending the hostage crisis without firing a single shot.”

# Election of Yap Pian Hon as MCA National Vice President confirms that the entire MCA leadership must bear collective responsibility for the Selangor Islamic Law Administration Enactment

The election of Yap Pian Hon as one of the four elected MCA National Vice President is a bonus for the DAP. It confirms that the entire MCA leadership must bear collective responsibility for the Selangor Islamic Law Administration Enactment. </u>

With Yap Pian Hon becoming one of the four elected National Vice Presidents of MCA, the MCA national leadership cannot continue to ‘pass the buck’ saying that it is a Selangor State problem, or the fault of the eight Selangor MCA Assemblymen or just put the blame on Yap Pian Hon.

If Yap Pian Hon had lost out in the MCA party elections, the MCA might be able to argue in the next general elections that Pian Hon had been ‘punished’ for the Selangor Islamic Law Administration Enactment. But now, the people can see that instead of being ‘punished’ for the Selangor Islamic Law Administration Enactment, Yap Pian Hon is being ‘rewarded’ instead!

If after committing the great political irresponsibility, negligence and sin of the Selangor Islamic Law Administration Enactment, Yap Pian Hon could still be ‘rewarded’ and rise up in the ranks of the MCA leadership, it is clear that the Chinese community and the Malaysian people cannot expect any good from the MCA national leadership whatsoever.

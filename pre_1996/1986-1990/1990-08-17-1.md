# Call on Anwar Ibrahim to give a clear-cut statement whether Professor Syed Hussein Alatas is on leave prior to resignation as University of Malaya Vice Chancellor

The Education Minister, Anwar Ibrahim, should give a clear-cut statement-whether Professor Syed Hussein Alatas is on leave prior to resignation as University of Malaya Vice Chancellor.</u>

It is most unhealthy that on educational matters, like the position of the Vice Chancellor of 
the University of Malaya and the new Education Bill 1990, there is more and more secrecy 
and mystery which goes against the very ethics and principles of a democratic and open government.

Newspapers had quoted sources as saying that the University of Malaya’s Deputy Vice Chancellor   (Personnel), Professor Mohamed Taib Osman, has been appointed acting Vice Chancellor and 
that he    had been given the specific task of carrying out the restricting of key administrative and academic posts made by Syed Husien Alatas.

It is significant that the University of Malaya Academic Staff Union yesterday cancelled its plans to picket over what it described as ‘irregularities’ in appointment of deans in various in the faculties.

If it is true that Professor Mohamed Taib Osman’s appointment as Acting Vice Chancellor is to 
undo and cancel all the adminis¬trative and academic appointments made by Professor Syed Hussein Alatas, then the Malaysian public is entitled to know the truth and all details - who are going to be dropped Or demoted and how many administrative and academic posts are to be affected by such 
re-ap¬pointments. 

Is Professor Syed returning to re-assume the post of Vice Chancellor of University of Malaya after 
all his administrative and academic appointments, including the appointment of deans had been 
changed and replaced?

2. DAP welcomes the rejection of three GSP withdrawal petitions

DAP welcomes the rejection by the United States Government of the three petitions calling for the withdrawa1 of Ma1aysia’s privileges under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP).

A United States Trade Representative (USTR) has disclosed that the three petitions for the 
withdrawal of Malaysia’s GSP submitted by the international Labour Rights Education and 
Research Fund (1L-RERF), the American Federation of Labour-Congress of Industrial Organ-isations (AFL-CJO) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers had been rejected.

Although the thee petitions for the withdrawal of the GSP from Malaysia had not been 
successful, the Malaysian Government should not be complacent, and should review its labour 
laws to ensure that they comply with international labour law standards.

# Ooi Ean Kwong, Karpal Singh and I should all be referred to the Committee of Privileges

The New Sunday Times reported that the Gerakan State Government is likely to call for a special sitting of he State Legislative Assembly next month to refer DAP Assemblyman for Bukit Glugor, Karpal Singh, to the Committee of Privileges.</u>

If there is going to be a special sitting of the State Assembly, then the Penang Speaker, Datuk Ooi Ean Kwong, Karpal Singh and I myself should all be referred to the Committee of Privileges.

Ean Kwong should be reffered to the Committee of Privileges for bringing shame to the Assembly in summoning the Police to the State Assembly, not only to the precincts of the Assembly but to violate the sanctity of thaw Assembly Chamber by entering into the inner sanctum of the Assembly.

If Ean Kwong cannot control decorum in the House without turning the State Assembly into a police camp or cantonment, then he has brought shame and dishonour to the Assembly, and he should be referred to the Committee of Privileges.

I am prepared to go before the Committee of Privileges to prove my assertion in the Assembly that the Gerakan President, Datuk Dr. Lim Keng Yaik, is a liar because of his untrue version of the secret Kamunting talks between Ooi Ean Kwong and myself when I was in detention under the Internal Security Act in Kamunting during Operation Lalang.

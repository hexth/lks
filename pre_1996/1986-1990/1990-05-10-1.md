# DAP deplores Ghafar’s resort to the politics of fear to win the next general elections

DAP deplores the attempt by the Deputy Prime Minister, Ghafar Baba, to resort to threats and the politics of fear to win the next general elections for the Barisan National.</u>

Ghafar said in Raub yesterday a wrong choice of Government by the people would only result in chaos and bloodshed in the country.

Is Ghafar suggesting that if the people vote any of the Opposition parties in the next year general elections, there would be chaos and bloodshed in Malaysia?

Now that the Communist Party of Malaysia (CPM) have reached an agreement with the Malaysian Government to end the 41-year armed communist struggle, why is Ghafar Baba insurrecting the threat of chaos and bloodshed, when all the present Opposition parties are committed to the peaceful, democratic and Constitutional form of struggle?

Is Ghafar Baba suggesting that if the Barisan National parties lose, they will create chaos and bloodshed, when all the Opposition Parties have accepted the verdict of the people in the general elections.

Top government leaders like the Deputy Prime Minister should set a good example of responsible leadership and not make irresponsible statement like one he made in Raub yesterday.

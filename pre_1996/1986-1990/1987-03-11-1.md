# Call on Home Ministry to explain the tearing out of the ‘Viewpoint’ Page of Asiaweek on Shariah Law in Malaysia 												
The March 8, 1987 issue of ASIAWEEK has been released by the Ministry of Home Affairs for circulation in Malaysia, with the ‘Viewpoints’ Page torn out.</u>

I understand that the ‘offending’ Viewpoints were on Shariah Law in Malaysia, where two Malaysians were interviewed, one the Chairman of the Ulamak Association in Malaysia, and the other being Kassim Ahmad.

The Malaysian public are entitled to know the reasons for the Home Ministry tearing out the ‘Viewpoints’ Page from Asiaweek, and whether this marks a new Ministry of Home Affairs attitude to publications and foreign journals.

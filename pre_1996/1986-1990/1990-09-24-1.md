# Call on Anwar Ibrahim to stop ‘politicising’ the Education Act 1990 and his attacks on Dong Jiao Zhong

Education Minister, Anwar Ibrahim, should stop ‘poliiticising’ the education Act 1990</u>

Last night, Anwar was shown on television news making a most emotional and hysterical attack against Dong Jiao Zhong with regard to their letter to him before deciding to join the Education Act Consultative Council, denouncing the Chinese educationists as anti- Bahasa Malaysia and anti-Islam.

What is shocking is that the Education Minister could go round the country making emotional and hysterical attacks on the dong Jiao Zhong when the three two organizations have decided to send representatives to the Education Act Consultative Council.

How can Anwar Ibrahim claim that he want to have meaningful consultation process in the Education Act Consultative Council when he is going round the country attacking members of the Council on their integrity and even loyalty, and virtually telling them that they are not welcome in the Consultative Council.

I am shocked by Anwar Ibrahim’s emotional and hysterical speeches recently. I would advise Anwar Ibrahim to cool down, as he must not forget that he is Education Minister and must not set a bad example to the young generation of Malaysians by being emotional and hysterical on television every night.

If Anwar Ibrahim wants to continue to attack the Dong Jiao Zhong with regard to the Education Act Consultative Council in emotional and irrational terms although these two organisations have sent representatives to the Education Act Consultative Council, then he should make it clear whether he really welcome their participation, or is thinking of ways to provoke them to pull out their representatives from the Education Act Consultative Council.

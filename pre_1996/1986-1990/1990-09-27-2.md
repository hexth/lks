# Tan Kok Wai being called up to explain the FT DAP situation

I am officially calling up the Federal Territory DAP State Secretary and MP for Sungei Besi, Sdr Tan Kok Wai, to explain the Federal Territory DAP situation.</u>

Sdr. Lee Lam Thye has refused to withdraw his resignation letter as FT DAP Chairman because he was convinced that he was the target of an “insidious campaign in FT DAP involving certain FT DAP leaders.’

I will also be meeting the other FT DAP leaders and officials over the problem.

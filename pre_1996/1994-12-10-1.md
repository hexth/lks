DAP calls on the Barisan Nasional Government to adopt seven new principles to prevent land acquisition abuses and injustices - </u>

These seven new principles are: 

* 1. The publication of state government guideline on land acquisition to prevent abuses and injust ices to tie people; 

* 2. Giving aggrieved landowners the right to challenge land acquisitions which violate the state government guideline on land acquisition: 

* 3. Before any major project Involving acquisition of land is implemented, there should be a public enquiry to hear objections from interested and affected parties. Such objections should not be restricted to the inadequacy but also as to the social, economic, cultural and ecological loss to the community caused by such an acquisition. 

* 4. A clear distinction between land acquisition for public purpose like the building of schools, hospitals and government complexes and land acquisition for development by private companies or individuals whereby higher compensations would be given in the latter case, based on the intended development potential of the land; 

* 5. In cases of acquisition for private development, the affected landowners, whether large estate companies or smallholders should also be given the first option of participating in joint venture development of the land so that they could share in the profits of development. 

* 6. Land acquisitions by government agencies like Penang Development Corporation, PERDA and UDA should not be classified as for pub1ic purpose if they are meant for development which would eventually benefit private companies and individuals 

7. The establishment of a Land Acquisition Arbitration Tribunal to arbitrate and resolve land acquisition controversies under the above principles.

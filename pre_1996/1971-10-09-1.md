Complaints by the people of Tenang

While on a visit to the Tenang DAP Branch in Segamat, district, Johore, last week, I received several complaints and representations about government neglect of the welfare of the people of Tenang.

For instance, the public telephone booth and the postal box had been spoilt for nearly two years, and had not been replaced, causing great inconvenience to the poor villagers of Tenang.

I have written to the telephone and postal authorities drawing their attention to the matter.

There were also complaints of misuse of public funds. I have written to the Director of Anti-Corruption Agency of Johore to investigate into a serious allegation of improper allocation of land in Tenang. The land was not allocated to the Tenang villagers, but to Segamat towns-people who are members of the ruling party. This is clearly abuse and improper allocation of land.

# Megat Junid surprised that his two-week ultimatum to Chinese newspapers has resulted in virtual black-out of DAP news, speeches and statements

		Deputy Home Minister, Datuk Megat Junid today expressed surprise that his two-week ultimatum to three Chinese newspapers threatening to revoke their printing permits has resulted in the virtual black-out of DAP news, speeches and statements in these newspapers for over a week.</u>

		I met the Deputy Home Minister in the Home Ministry this morning, and at the meeting, I said that the effect of his public learning to the three Chinese newspapers was the black-out of DAP news and coverage, which is regarded as victory of certain Barisan Nasional component parties in making use of the Home Ministry to achieve their political purposes in the coming general elections.

		Megat gave an assurance that when he issued a strong warning to chief editors of three Chinese newspapers to stop publishing articles which could "undermine racial and religious harmony", he had never instructed the Chinese newspapers or intended that they should black-out Opposition and DAP news and Coverage.

		Megat said he is satisfied so far with the three Chinese newspapers since his warning and reiterated that it is not his intention to get the newspapers to black out the DAP or any Opposition, and that his stand on mass media political coverage is that the newspapers should be fair to all political parties concerned.

		Megat also expressed surprise when I told him that his warning to Chinese newspapers had not only resulted in the removal of whole pages of political coverage in anticipation of the coming general elections, but also the closure of certain newspaper columns.

		The Deputy Home Minister said that he never intended the newspapers concerned to close down their political pages, as what he suggested to the chief editors with regard to political coverage is that they should maintain a fair and balanced approach to all political parties - and not the blackout of the news or coverage of any one political party.

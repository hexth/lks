# Malaysianisation of top editorial posts in Malaysian press

As a former newspaperman myself, I fully support the memorandum submitted by the National Union of Journalists to the Prime Minister on expatriate journalists in the Malaysian press.

Over the years, the Malaysian newspaper who have non-citizens in the top editorial posts have not made any serious attempt to train local, talented journalists to take over all key editorial posts. 

Malaysia has been independent for 15 years and it is clearly unacceptable that the key posts in a sensitive and important sector as the press should continue to be in the hands of expatriates.

The Government should require the newspapers to lay down a programme of full Malaysianisation of all key editorial posts in Malaysian press.

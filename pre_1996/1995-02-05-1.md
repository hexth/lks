# Anwar commended for his advice which he should himself follow that differences in opinions and political affiliations should not be the basis for anyone to hurl abuses and make false accusations

		Deputy Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim should be commended for his advice in Bukit Mertajam yesterday which he should himself follow that differences in opinions and political affiliations should not be the basis for anyone to hurl abuses and make false accusations.</u>

		Recently, Anwar has been electioneering in various states, where he made wild and baseless allegations against the DAP as being "anti-Malay" and even as "traitors to development" -"pengkhianat pembangunan".

		These are highly mischievious and irresponsible allegations common in the sixties and seventies, and should not have been revived by a leader who wants to lead the country into the 21st century.

DAP calls for an independent panel to assess the values of 33,000 acres in Gelang Patah and Tanjong Kupang

		I welcome the statement by the Johore Mentri Besar, Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin that the Johore Government will look into complaints of low compensation for land acquired for the second Johore-Singapore Link and Second Johore Bahru township project.

		Tan Sri Muhyiddin should remember that in 1990, he himself advised the Tanjong Kupang and Gelang Patah smallholders not to sell their land on the open market, when buyers were offering RM100,000 per acre on the ground that land prices would appreciate when applications for the Second Johore-Singapore Link and the Second Johore Bahru township projects have been approved by the Government.

		However, after the approval of these two projects, the 33,000 acres in Tanjong Kupang and Gelang Patah were compulsorily acquired, and the compensation offered by the State Government was as low as RM26,000 per acre.

		Tan Sri Muhyiddin should also know that although the Gelang Patah and Tanjong Kupang smallholders are being offered RM26,000 to RM80,000 compensation per acre, the land in Gelang Patah for industrial purpose is being marketted overseas for over a million ringgit an acre - or over ten times the compensation value.

		This is a gross injustice which is completely intolerable in any society which accords high priority to socio-economic justice.

		DAP calls on the Johore Mentri Besar to set up an independent panel to assess the land values of the 33,000 acres of land acquired in Gelang Patah and Tanjong Kupang, taking into full account their potential values after the approval for the Second Johore-Singapore Link and Second Johore Bahru new township projects.

# DAP Central Executive Committee to meet in Petaling Jaya tomorrow to discuss latest political development.

The DAP Central Executive Committee will meet in Petaling Jaya tomorrow, and will discuss the new government regulations on students intending to go overseas and the proposed reduction of university places by the New Zealand government.

The Central Executive Committee will also discuss the Essential (Security Cases) Regulations and the legal and political measures that have been taken to challenge it.</u>

I will also brief the Central Executive Committee of the two motion which I will move in the Dewan Rakyat on the first sitting on Oct.27, both to seek leave of the Dewan Rakyat to move two private memberâ€™s bills, one to amend the Prevention of Corruption Act 1961 to make I an offence for a Minister, Deputy Minister, Parliamentary Secretary, Mentri-Mentri Besar Member of Parliament or State Assemblymen, or any public officer, who has amassed wealth or property disproportionate to his known sources of income, and two, to repeal Clauses 21 (2) of the 1961 Education Act to remove the discretionary power of the Education Minister to convert Chinese and Tamil primary schools into national primary schools.

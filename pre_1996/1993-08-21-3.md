# I will continue to give full hacking to Karpal Singh as Penang DAP State Chairman

Bayan Baru MP Sdr. Ahmad Nor is fully entitled to vie for the post of the Penang DAP State Chairman if he is nominated at the DAP Penang State Convention tomorrow.</u>

Under the DAP constitution, every DAP member is entitled to stand for any post in accordance with its rules and provisions – although recently, there had been a vicious press campaign claiming that the DAP is undemocratic in not allowing democratic elections in the Party.

Ahmad Nor’s vying for the post of Penang DAP State Chairman if he is nominated proves the full working of democracy inside the DAP.

Speaking as a Penang DAP Member of Parliament, I will continue to give full backing to Jelutong MP, Sdr. Karpal Singh as Penang DAP State Chairman as there is no one who could match Karpal’s political record and contributions in Penang or Malaysia.

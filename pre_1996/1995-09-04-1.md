# Malaysian Parliamentary Group on Environment and Development seeks a briefing from Anwar Ibrahim on the RM15 billion Bakun dam project

The Malaysian Parliamentary Group on Environment and Development (MPGED) which was formed last Wednesday to focus the attention of MPs on the two critical areas of environment and development has written to the Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim to ask him for a briefing on the RM15 billon Bakun dam project in his capacity as Chairman of the Cabiner Committee on Bakun.</u>

The MPGED will also be approaching the Minister for Science, Technology and Environment, Datuk Law Hieng Ding to discuss how his Ministry and the Department of Environment (DOE) could assist the MPGED in the areas of its special concern, including arranging for a visit for members of MPGED to the Bakun area.

The MPGED is open to Members of Parliament regardless of party who are concerned about environment and development so that MPs with similar interests can come together to ensure greater government information, accountability and transparency as well as monitor international developments on these two issues.

In this connection, the recent lament by the Chairman of the Rio Earth Summit, Maurice Strong, that since the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development which promoted conventions on climate change and the conservation of plants and animals and produced an 800-page action plan on ecologically sustainable development, there had been “a recession environmental will at the level of government“should be a matter of serious concern to the Malaysian Parliament and all NGOs.

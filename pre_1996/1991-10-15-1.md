# DAP calls on Myanmar military junta to immediately release Aung an Suu Kyi to exercise her mandate to form a democratic government in Myanmar given to her by May 1990 general elections results

DAP hails the award of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize to Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and endorses the Nobel Committee’s citation of her struggle as “one of the most extraordinary examples of civil courage in Asia in recent decades.”</u>

Aung San Suu Kyi has not only become a symbol of the fight for democracy and human rights in Myanmar, but an important symbol in the struggle against oppression in the world.

DAP calls on the Myanmar military junta to immediately and unconditionally release Aung San Suu Kyi from detention and to exercise her mandate from the people of Myanmar to form and head a democratically-elected government.

Despite Aung San Suu Kyi’s detention in the last two years and the restrictions on campaigning, her National League for Democracy won a landslide victory in the May 1990 general election, winning 392 out of the 485 contested seats.

DAP calls on the Malaysian Government and the other ASEAN governments to make a clear and unequivocal stand to demand that the Myanmar military junta should accept the democratic verdict of the people of Myanmar as expressed in the May 1990 general elections, and let Aung San Suu Kyi exercise the mandate given to her to form and head a democratically-elected government based on the results of the 1990 general elections.

DAP to move a motion in Parliament on Monday to hail the Nobel Peace Prize Award to Aung San Suu Kyi and to call for her immediate release to form a democratic government in Myanmar

Malaysia and ASEAN should consistently and persistently put pressure on the Myanmar military junta to restore democracy and human rights in Myanmar in international forums and should re-examine all aspects of their relationships between the ASEAN nations and the Myanmar military junta.

DAP will move a motion at the first day of the 39-day budget meeting beginning on Monday to hail the Nobel Peace prize award to Aung San Suu Kyi and to call on the Myanmar military junta to release her and return to her the mandate of government as decided in the May 1990 general elections. I hope this motion this secure the support of MPs from all parties.

# DAP to raise in parliamentary next month the Luak Bay ‘Millionaires Row’ Scandal where some 10.5 km of beach front had been closed off from public access as the type of development which sacrificed public rights to private interests

I have instructed the Miri DAP branch to make a detailed study to assemble all available information on the Luak Bay ‘millionaires row’ scandal so that I could highlight it in Parliament next month.</u>

It is most shocking that the Sarawak State Government could alienate choice beach-front land to private developers and close off some 10 kilometres of beaches from access to the public, which is a clear case of sacrificing public rights to private interests.

Teh Luak Bay ‘millionaire’s row’ scandal in Miri is a good example of the type of development which is wrong in Sarawak and Malaysia, for three important reasons:

* Firstly, it widens the disparity between the haves and gave-nots – as the thousands of squatters on Canada Hill are still waiting for land to have roof over their head;

* Secondly, it sacrifices public rights to private interests with the closure of some 10 kilometres of beach access to the public; and 

* Thirdly, the secretive manner in which the land at Luak Bay had been alienated to a handful of developers. There should have been a public tendering process if the State Government had wanted to alienate land at Luak Bay for development so as to get the best offers from the bidders. Furthermore, the plans for the development of Luak Bay should have been made public to allow for public consultation, debate and input.

The State Government should release full details about the Luak Bay development, identity of the developers and individuals who had been alienated land, the size, the date of alienation, the premium paid and the conditions of alienation.

Together with the DAP MP for Bintulu, Chiew Chin Sing, I am prepared to speak up for the people of Miri in Parliament so that their voice, hopes, worries, needs and fears could be heard in the highest forum in the land.

I am prepared to start off by speaking on the Luak bay ‘millionaire row’ scandal in the budget meeting of Parliament, which will met for two months from Octoer 16, and I invite all who have information on the Luak Bay ‘millionaire row’ scandal or other subjects of concern to the people of Miri to communicate with me – either through the Miri DAP Branch or to me, c/o Office of Leader of Opposition, Parliament or DAP Headquarters, 24 Jalan 10/9, Paramount Garden, 46300 Selangor (Tel: 03-7578022; Fax – 03-7575718)

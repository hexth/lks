# Penang DAP to keep watchful eye on whether the Barisan Nasional has abandoned its plot to register about 2,000 Malay voters resident and working in Bayan Baru in Tanjong Bungah as key element in Save-Koh Tsu Koon-Operation

Penang Chief Minister, Dr. Koh Tsu Koon has denied that there is a Barisan Nasional plot to register about 2,000 Malay workers from other states who are resident and working in Bayan Baru in Tanjong Bungah as a key element in the Save-Koh Tsu Koon-Operation.</u>

Tsu Koon’s denial is to be expected, but what is most noteworthy is why it has taken the Penang Chief Minister nearly one whole week before issuing this denial?

Nobody expects Tsu Koon or anyone involved in this Save-Koh Tsu Koon Operation to register ‘phantom voters’ from Bayan Baru as well as from other constituencies, including from the Penang mainland, as voters in Tanjong Bungah to confess and admit as to what they are doing.

I do not know whether as a result of the DAP expose of the Barisan Nasional plot to register several thousand ‘phantom voters’ in Tanjon Bungah in its ‘Save-Koh Tsu Koon Operation’, this operation has been abandoned, Penang DAP will be keeping a very watchful eye on the voters’ registration campaign for the look-out for Gerakan ‘phantom voters’, not only in Tanjong Bungah, but in a few key constituencies which Gerakan considers as vital to defend in the DAP Battle of Tanjong 3 in the next general elections.

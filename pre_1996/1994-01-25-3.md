# DAP welcomes the lifting of the restrictive residence on the remaining five Sabahan ISA detainees accused of plotting to take Sabah out of Malaysia

DAP welcomes the lifting of the restrictive residence on the remaining five Sabahan ISA detainees accused of plotting to take Sabah out of Malaysia, namely Abdul Rahman Ahmad , Damit Undikai , Albinus Yudah , Benedict Topin and Vincent Chung.</u>

The ISA should never have been used against them as well as other Sabahans , including Dr. Jeffrey Kitingan , as this is another blatant example of the abuse of ISA for political purposes.

Strange things are happening in Sabah politics where friends have suddenly become foes and foes instant friends.

PBS leaders who were accused of being responsible for the ‘stb-in –the – back’ PBS decision before the 1980 general elections to quit Barisan Nasional and whose removal was regarded as a pre-condition before PBS could be allowed back into the Barisan Nasional suddenly became an ‘ally’ of the Barisan Nasional against the PBS.

The voters of Sabah must exercise their voting rights carefully wisely on February 18 and 19 .

# Will Chua Jui Meng publicly apologise if I prove him wrong in alleging that I had not commented on Datuk Suhaimi’s statement of December 3, 1991

MCA National Vice Chairman, Chua Jui Meng, attacked me in a fierce statement in today’s press which is typical of MCA statements- a rojak of abuses and lies.</u>

Chua Jui Meng continued to plug the lie that the DAP supported Islamic State, and to strengthen his lie, he asked why after 50 days I had not commented or reacted to the statement by the Semangat 46 Secretary-General, Datuk Suhaimi Kamarrudin, on December 3, 1991 quoting him as saying that DAP supports Islamisation policies.`

Will Chua Jui Meng publicly apologise to the DAP for the MCA’s campaign of lies if I can prove him wrong in alleging that I had not commented and clarified the report on Suhaimi’s statement?

As Chua Jui Meng is responding to my Malacca speech last weekend, he should not run away from the following questions I had posed:

Firstly, isn’t it true that he is the MCA Deputy Minister most impatient with MCA Deputy President Lee Kim Sai remaining in the Cabinet for he wants to replace Lee Kim Sai as the fourth MCA Minister in Cabinet?

Secondly, isn’t it true that to curry the favour of UMNO leaders so that he could realise his Ministerial dream, he is prepared to ‘eat his own words’ at previous MCA seminars- as for instance, he had in 1988 publicly opposed ethnicity as a criteria to fight poverty, but last week, he give full support to the proposal to divide ‘hard-core’ poor in Malaysia into bumiputeras and non-bumiputeras, and opposed the DAP proposal to extend the %500 million revolving fund to provide $5,000 interest-free loan to ‘bumiputera hardcore poor’ to buy Amanah Saham Bumiputera shares to ‘non-bumiputera hardcore poor’ as well?

Can Chua Jui Meng deny both?

Let me advise Chua Jui Meng, that those who stay in glass houses should not try to throw stones.

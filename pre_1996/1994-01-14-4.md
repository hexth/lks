# The Klang Valley phones jam mess is another proof that though privatization results in greater profits , it is no guarantee of better service or greater sensitivity to consumer needs 

The telephone jam mess in the Klang Valley in the past few months is another proof that though privatization results in greater profits for the company , it is no gurantee of better service or greater sensitivity to consumer needs.</u>

Subscribers in Petaling  Jaya in the past few months have found the telephone service a great tortune , with great difficulties in diallung in or dialing out  , with protracted interferences and noises in the background , and the constant cutting off of telephone lines during conversations.

This Klang Valley phones lam mess has alos caused hardships and financial losses to the users and businesses .

It is most shocking that the Minister for Energy , Telecommunications and Posts , Datuk Seri S, Samy Vellu , could allow the Telekon telephone jam mess in Klang Valley to go on for so long without any effective Ministerial action to protect the public interest . What is the Ministry doing to resolve this problem?

We are seeing another example of the evils of pribatisation , where there is no real government monitoring of the privatized services to safeguard public interests.

Telekoms Malaysia camimpose RM 50 fine for reconnection of telephone service for failure opr prompt payment of telephone bills, but when it causes hardships and financial losses , as in the Klang Valley phones jam mess , is it prepared to compenmonthly telephone bill until restoration of efficient telephone service?

In this connection Telekom Malaysia should clarify whether one main cause for the Klang Valley telephone jam mess is its introduction of a new gadget , known as ‘ one plus three’ whereby the wire splits into three for subscribers so that for one main line from them telephone exchange meant to serve one subscriber is now used to serve three subscribers.

# DAP welcomes the stand of the Non-Aligned Movement Chairman, President Suharto, rejecting proposals that Bosnia’s capital Sarajevo be placed under UN administrative control

DAP welcomes the stand of the Non-Aligned Movement Chairman, President Suharto, rejecting proposals that Bosnia’s capital, Sarajevo, be placed under UN administrative control.</u>

The placing of Sarajevo under UN administrative control would be regarded as a victory for Serb aggression in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and as an important step in their long-term design to make Sarajevo the capital of Bosnian Serbia.

President Suharto is right when in his letter to the United Nations Security Council last Thursday, he said that the continued Serb military aggression, carnage and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia-Herzegovina is the result of the failure of the international community to implement UN Security Council resolutions,

NAM should form a special caucus on the Bosnian cause to provide international leadership to end the Bosnian Holocaust

The Non-Aligned Movement must also bear responsibility for this international failure for it had also failed to be the international vanguard to defend the Bosnian cause.

The voice of NAM should be heard loud and clear in all the capitals of the West on the Bosnian issue in the past two years - but this was not the case.

The Non-Aligned Movement should form a special caucus on the Bosnian issue comprising ten to fifteen nations which should, be entrusted with the responsibility of pressing the Bosnian cause in the name of the Non-Aligned Movement, in the United Nations and in all international forums to end the Bosnian holocaust.

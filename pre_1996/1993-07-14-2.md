# DAP calls on Bukit China trustees, Cheng Hoon Teng, not to delay any further and to make clear its stand on the use of the DAP Save-Bukit China and Oppose-$2 million-Quit Rent One-Person One-Dollar Fund to erect a memorial on Bukit China to commemorate the Save Bukit China struggle

I call on the Bukit China trustees, Cheng Hoon Teng, not to delay any further and to make clear its stand on the use of the DAP Save-Bukit China and Oppose-$2 million-Quit Rent One-Person One-Dollar Fund to erect a memorial on Bukit China to commemorate the Save Bukit China struggle.</u>

If Cheng Hoon Teng opposes the use of the DAP Save-Bukit China and Oppose-$2 million-Quit Rent One-Person One-Dollar Fund, which stands at $33,732,79 as at 15th June 1993 to erect a memorial on Bukit China to commemorate the historic Save Bukit China struggle in 1984, then the Bukit China trustees should state its stand on tin-donation of the money to Pay Fong Chinese Independent Secondary School, Dong/Zhiao Zheng education fund or Southern College.

The DAP national leadership conference in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday will consider the proposal that the DAP donate the money to Pay Fong Chinese Independent Secondary School, Dong/Zhiao Zhong education fund or Southern College, which had been made from outside the Party.


There are also other proposals for the use of the DAP Save Bukit China One-Person One-Dollar Fund - that it must be used to commemorate the historic struggle of the Save Bukit China campaign so that it would be an inspiration for the present and future generations in their defense of their fundamental historic, cultural and. citizenship rights, as in the publication of an authoritative work on the whole Save Bukit China struggle in 1984.

At the DAP Cameron Highlands anniversary dinner last Saturday night, I first declared that if the MCA President, Datuk Dr. Ling Liong Sik, dared to declare publicly that he is not satisfied with ray announcement of the DAP Save-Bukit China and Oppose-$2 million-Quit Rent One-Person One-Dollar Fund, I am prepared to arrange for a sec-Gnu 'Lim Kit Siang-Ling Liong Sik mutual questioning' in Malacca within a week.


At this second 'Lim Kit Siang-Ling Liong Sik mutual questioning', Liong Sik can raise any question on the DAP Save Bukit China Fund.

Kit Siang gives Liong Sik final three days to publicly declare that he is not satisfied with my announcement of the DAP Save-Bukit China One-Person One-Dollar Account

If Liong Sik has any valid questions to raise about the DAP Save Bukit China Fund, he should come to this second "Lim Kit Siang-Ling Liong Sik mutual questioning' and raise them, and not ask low-level MCA subordinates to shout them in the press. This would show that Liong Sik himself has no confidence in the validity of the questions being raised by the low-level MCA subordinates in the newspapers.

Five days have passed since I declared that if Liong Sik had dared to declare publicly that he is not satisfied with my announcement of the DAP Save-Bukit China One-Person One-Dollar Fund I would arrange a second ' Lim Kit Siang-Ling Liong Sik mutual questioning' within a week in Malacca, but there has been total silence from Liong Sik - who seemed to have disappeared from public view.

I am giving Liong Sik the another and final three days up to Saturday to publicly declare that he is not satisfied with my announcement of the Save-Bukit China One-Person One-Dollar Fund, or he must face the full consequences.

_The DAP Organising Secretary, Mr. Lim Kit Siang, today (9.11.68) issued the following statement:_

I have already accepted the challenge by Dr. Syed Naguib Alatas to me to have a public debate on the Gerakan’s cultural policy.

But to date, we seemed to have agreed only on two things: the chairmanship of the debate by Mr. D. R. Seenivasagam, and the date of November 24.

To avoid misunderstanding, and avoid having to argue on November 24 about the procedures of the debate, I will outline the details of the debate:

Subject: Gerakan’s cultural policy, as enunciated by Dr. Syed Naguib Alatas publicly, which I have described as an attempt to Indonesianise Malaysian culture.</u>

Place: Chinese Assembly Hall, which can accommodate more than 1,500 people, rather than the MARA Auditorium, which can accommodate less than 500 people.

Procedure: 
(i) Opening statement by Dr. Syed Naguib Alatas for 45 minutes.
(ii) Opening statement by me for 45 minutes.
(iii) One hour for question time
(iv) Winding by Dr. Naguib Alatas, or any other Gerakan leader, for 30 minutes.
(v) Winding up by me for 30 minutes.

Total time of debate: 3 ½ hours.

I hope Dr. Syed Naguib Alatas will give his agreement to the above, so that we can once and for all, remove all uncertainties about the debate – ast to whether it is going to be held at all in the first place.

# DAP welcome halt of American bombing in North Vietnam

The Democratic Action Party welcomes the halt of American bombing in North Vietnam.

A light has at last appeared at the end of the long tunnel towards a Vietnam settlement.

The bombing halt was motivated largely by President Johnson’s determination to be remembered in history as the man who ended the costly and disastrous Vietnam war, although he was the person who escalated it, and to bolster the chances of Vice President Hubert Humprey in the November 5 American Presidential elections.</u>

The reduction of North Vietnamese forces from South Vietnam is indication that Hanoi is also serious and sincere in wanting to reach a settlement to the Vietnam conflict.

The DAP hopes that the second phase of the Paris peace talks, which is to be joined by the Vietchong’s National Liberation Front and the South Vietnamese Government, will lead to the end of the twenty-year Vietnamese agony and fratricide.

A whole generation of Vietnamese who had been brought up in war should now begin to turn their energies towards national reconstruction and reconciliation of Vietnamese with Vietnamese.

_Speech by DAP Organising Secretary, Mr. Lim Kit Siang, at a condolence meeting for the late D.R. Seenivasagam hold at the Puchong 14 m.s. DAP Branch on Wednesday, 19th March 1969 at 6 p.m._

 We gather here today to honour the memory of Ipoh’s most famous son and Malaysia’s most outstanding opposition leader in the last 15 years, the late D.R. Seenivasagam.

Malaysians have lost a leader and a fearless crusader against corruption, racialism and all forms of social injustice and inequality, whether between the races, languages or even classes. 

For 15 years, D.R. Seenivasagam dedicated himself to one noble idea 0 the realization of a equal and just Malaysian society, where there are no first-class or second-class citizens, and where all languages, including Tamil, Chinese and English share official status with Malay, and where is no exploitation of man by man, race by race , language by language.

For 15 years, D.R. Seenivasagam held high the torch of individual rights and liberties against growing government threats from the Alliance.</u>

Corrupt politicians live in fear of a possible expose by D.R. Seenivasagam.

To those who cherish the memory of D.R. Seenivasagam, it is their task to continue the life-work of D.R. Seenivasagam to continue the struggle for justice and equality, against corruption and political dishonesty. 

This will be the best memorial for D.R. Seenivasagam.

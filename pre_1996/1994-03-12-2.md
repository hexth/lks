# My first question in the April Parliament will be on the British mass media allegations on corruption, bribery and improprieties

My first question in the April Parliament, which will be officially opened for the last time by the present Yang di Pertuan Agong, Raja Azlan Shah before the expiry of his term on April 26, will be on the British mass media allegations on corruption, bribery and improprieties against the Malaysian Government and its leaders.</u>

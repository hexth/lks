# DAP supports the holding of the 2000 Olympic Games in Beijing, to mark the coming-of-age of the Asian Century

DAP  supports the holding of the Olympic Games in the Year 2,000 in Beijing to mark the cosaing-of-age of the Asian Century, the taking  of  China's  proper place in global affairs  as  well  as the maintenance and expansion of China's international links.</u>

The United States Congressional vote of 287 against 99 to oppose the holding of the 2000 Olympic Games in Beijing is most improper.

In view of the United States Congressional stand, the Malaysian Parliament should seriously consider passing a motion to endorse: the holding of 2,000 Olympics in Beijing.

Since the revival of Olympic Games in 1896, Olympic Games have been staged only twice in Asian cities: Tokyo in 1964 and Seoul in 1988, while they have been staged in Europe, fifteen times and in the Americas five times.

In 1996, the world games would be held in the Americas again, where the five interlaced rings of the Olympic Games emblem would fly over Atlanta, U.S.A.

DAP calls on the International Olympic CoiBSTiitt.ee to award the Olympic Games 2,000 to Beijing as Asia's turn for another Olympics Games cannot be matched by anyone of the other six contender's to host the 2,000 Olympics, whether Sydney or Manchester, England.

The award of 2,000 Olympics to Beijing would have the effect of stimulating more reforms towards a more open society, both economically and politically.

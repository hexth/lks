# Sabah DAP instructed to prepare for the next general elections on the basis that there will be no co-operation or understanding with PBS in Sabah

		Sabah DAP has been instructed to prepare for the next general elections on the basis that there will be no co-operation or understanding with PBS in Sabah.</u>

		Last April, during my visit to Sabah, I had publicly expressed the DAP preparedness to co-operate with PBS in Sabah in the forthcoming parliamentary general elections, but in the past 10 months I had not received any response whatsoever from the PBS leadership.

		The current visit of the eight-man PBS delegation to Penang to spread its wings to Peninsular Malaysia is within the rights of the PBS and is therefore not worthy of much comment.

		However, the message is very clear, and this is why the Sabah DAP has been instructed not to wait any more for responses from the PBS and to 'go it aloneâ€™ in Sabah in the fielding of candidates for the parliamentary general elections.

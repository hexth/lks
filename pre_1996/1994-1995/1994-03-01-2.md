# DAP will query in April Parliament why University, of Malaya promoted an associate professor who had been guilty of the serious academic offence of plagiarism to full professorship

The DAP will guery in the April Parliament why the University of Malaya promoted an associate professor who had been guilty of the serious academic offence of plagiarism to full professorship.</u>

The associate professor concerned is one of the 27 associate professors in University of Malaya whose promotion to full professorship was announced yesterday.

The promotion of the associate professor who had plagiarised the work of students has not only undermined the reputation of the University of Malaya for intellectual and academic excellence and ethics; but also marred the promotion of the other 26 associate professors to full professorship at the same time.

To protect the academic and intellectual reputation and ethics, not only of University of Malaya, but of all universities in Malaysia, the Education Minister, Datuk Dr. Sulaiman Daud should direct the University of Malaya Council to rescind the promotion of the associate professor concerned.

# Call on Police to withdraw the report against Irene Fernandez for criminal defamation and to cooperate in an independent inquiry into Tenaganita allegations about maltreatment in Immigration detentiton camps 

I call on the Police to withdraw the report against Irene Fernandez for criminal defamation and to co-operate in an independent inquiry into Tenaganita allegations about maltreatment of Bangladeshi and other illegal immigrants in Immigration detention camps. </u>

The police should not be seen as a “bully” or vengeful in wanting to persecute Irene Fernandez for the Tenaganita allegations of maltreatment of Bangladeshi and other illegal immigrants in Immigration detention camps. 

In this connection, I welcome the announcement by the Deputy Home, Datuk Megat Juhid Megat Ayob on Saturday that the Government would set up a 10-member Board of Independent Visitors to look into the conditinn at the immigration detention camps and that the Board would be made up of “neutral” personalities including those from opposition parties and human rights groups. 

It is important that such a Board of Independent visit ors be given fall and untrammeled powers to look into the conditions of the detention camps so that It would have unquestioned credibility, both inside and outside the country, and help in safeguarding the international reputation of the country. 

Tenaganita’s Irene Fernandez should he appointed to the Board of independent Visitors. 

The Deputy Home Minister, Datuk Megat Junid should discuss with the Opposition the composition and terms of reference of the board of Independent visitors so flat such a Board could have the blessing and support of all sectors of Malaysian society.

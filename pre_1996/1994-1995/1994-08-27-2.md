# Inspector-General of Police should direct Bukit Aman to lodge a police report so that the police could commence investigations to comply with Mahathir’s directive in connection with the allegation that the Malacca Chief Minister, Tan Sri Rahim Tamby Cik, had an affair with a 15-year-old school girl

The CID Director Comm Said Awang said yesterday that the Police are still waiting for a police report in connection with the allegation that the UMNO Youth Leader and Malacca Chief Minister, Tan Sri Rahim Tamby Cik, had an affair with a 15-year-old school girl.</u>

He said that the police could only start investigations if there is a police report.

The Inspector-General of Police, Tan Sri Rahim Noor, should direct Bukit Aman to lodge a police report so that the police could commence investigations to comply with Mahathir’s directive to probe the allegation that the UMNO Youth Leader and Malacca Chief Minister had an affair with a 15-year-old school girl.

At the end of January this year, Tan Sri Rahim directed the Bukit Aman officials to lodge a police report in connection with the allegation in an Australian newspaper that the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) had paid senior opposition politicians in Malaysia tens of thousands of dollars in bribed – which later turned out to be ASIS bribery of UMNO MPs and leaders.

If the Bukit Aman police could lodge a police report itself on the allegation about ASIS bribery of Malaysian politicians, why can’t Bukit Aman police also lodge a police report based on Mahathir’s directive for a full probe into the allegation that Rahim Tamby Cik had an affair with a 15-year-old school girl?

Tan Sri Rahim Noor should realise that the allegation against Rahim Tamby Cik is many times more serious than the allegation of Australian secret agents bribing Malaysian politicians, and there is no reason why Bukit Aman should not lodge a police report on the Rahim Tamby Cik affair when it was prepared to lodge a police report on the ASIS allegation.

On Thursday, the Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed announced that the government had ordered an investigation into the allegation of Rahim Tamby Cik having an affair with a 15-year-old school girl.

How can there be a probe if the IGP refused to direct the Bukit Aman to lodge a police report on the allegation?

Tan Sri Rahim Noor should realise that UMNO leaders themselves have lost confidence in Rahim Tamby Cik, as evidenced in the following statements by various UMNO leaders:

* Statement by Mahathir, that although Rahim had protested his innocence, that was only Rahim’s version and the Prime Minister wanted to know from third parties;

* Statement by Deputy Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim that he had ‘no comments at this time’ on Rahim’s personal problems’ but his assurance that “tidak timbul soal ‘menutup’ skandal yang dilakukan mana-mana pempimpin kerajaan walaupun dari kalangan pemimpin parti itu sendiri”;

* Statement by the Terengganu Mentri Besar, Tan Sri Wan Mokhtar Ahmad, that “Kekuatan UMNO dan Barisan Nasional (BN) tetap akan kukuh walaupun Ketua Pemuda UMNO, Tan Sri Rahim Tamby Cik, mengundurkan diri atas sebab-sebab peribadi”; and

* Statement by UMNO Wanita Deputy Leader, Datuk Napsiah Omar, that “Rahim wajar mengundur jika terbukti tuduhan itu betul.”

The ball is in the court of the Police, which should pick up the ball and commence investigations as directed by the Prime Minister into the allegation against Rahim Tamby Cik having an affair with a 15-year-old school girl.

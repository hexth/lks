# I propose a stop of political exchanges between the MCA and DAP on the Tanah Putih land issue and that both parties co-operate to resolve the land problem of the Tanah Putih MCA members and farmers

		The Tanah Putih land issue in Gua Musang is not only an eye-opener to MCA members that their interests can be sacrificed by the MCA national leaders, but also a lesson to the people as to the lies that the MCA leadership could concoct against the DAP because of the coming general elections.</u>

		The DAP has listed some of the lies that the MCA national leadership has told about the Tanah Putih land issue, and we are prepared if challenged to give a full list of all the MCA lies propagated by the MCA leadership in the past month.

		The MCA national leadership is being most unfair and irresponsible in its treatment of the Tanah Putih MCA members and farmers.

		I call on the MCA national leaders to stop treating the Tanah Putih MCA members and farmers as pure political pawns in the MCA propaganda of lies against the DAP, and to take positive action to help the Tanah Putih MCA members and farmers to resolve their land problem.

		The DAP will never refuse to help the Tanah Putih farmers although 98 per cent of the Tanah Putih farmers are MCA members, but we do not want to be accused by the MCA national leadership of betraying their legal rights and claims which had been the MCA line after my visit to Tanah Putih on February 5.

I am prepared to meet Liong Sik to discuss measures that could be taken to help the Tanah Putih MCA members and farmers over their land problems

		I propose a stop of political exchanges between the MCA and DAP on the Tanah Putih land issue and that both parties co-operate to resolve the land problem of the Tanah Putih MCA members and farmers.

		I am prepared to meet the MCA President, Datuk Dr. Ling Liong Sik to discuss measures that could be taken to help the Tanah Putih MCA members and farmers over their land problems.
		Let Liong Sik make a clear stand on two matters:

* Firstly, as MCA maintains that the Tanah Putih MCA members and farmers have legal rights and claims to their land, what action is it taking to defend and uphold these legal rights; and

* Secondly, whether the MCA leadership would agree to the DAP fighting for the socio-economic rights of the Tanah Putih MCA members and farmers after the MCA had failed to establish the legal rights and claims of the Tanah Putih MCA members and farmers.


		Liong Sik should explain how long the MCA national leadership needs to establish as to whether the Tanah Putih MCA members and farmers have legal rights and claims or not.

		I hope the MCA national leadership is prepared to join hands with the DAP to defend the rights of the Tanah Putih MCA members and farmers, and stop its current tactics of sacrificing the rights and interests of the Tanah Putih MCA members and farmers in its propaganda campaign of lies against the DAP.

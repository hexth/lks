# DAP calls on the Myanmar military junta to stop going against the tide of history and initiate democratisastion process in Myanmar beginning with the unconditional release of Aung San Suu Kyi.

The first official meeting between Myanmar’s military junta and the Myanmese Opposition Leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, is a step in the right direction and the Myanmar military junta must be commended for taking such an initiative.</u>

DAP calls on the Myanmar military junta to stop going against the tide of history and to initiate democratisation process in Myanmar beginning with the immediate and unconditional release of Nobel Peace Prize winner, Aung San Suu Kyi, who had been detained since July 1989 and all other political detainees.

Myanmar, previously Burma, had stood high in international esteem during her early years of nationhood but has now become an international pariah because she has now one of the world’s worst records on human rights.

The Mynamese military junta must restore the country’s previous esteem in the international arena by through a process of reconciliation and democratisation with all forces inside Myanmar.

The time is long overdue for Myanmar to join the mainstream of humanity in the onward march towards greater freedoms, dignity, justice and human rights for her citizens.

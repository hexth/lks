# Is Tsu Daiz Zainuddin helping the small investors by creating a crash in the stock market?

The government economic adviser , Tun Daim Zainuddin has single handedly created a crash in the stock market in the last three days.</u>

The question that must be answered is whether Tun Daim Zainuddin is helping the small investors by creating a crash in the stock market – which have burnt the hands of the small investors , although it could have brought in new fortunes for the big players in the stock market.

As economic adviser , Tun Daim Zainuddin should have advised the Finance Minister , Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim , the Securities Commission and the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange to take precautionary measures where he feels that the stock market has reached unhealthy levels and not to create a crash of the stock market.

As an active player in the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange , another pertinent question is whether there was conflict of interest on the part of Tun Daim Zanuiddin as economic adviser when he is single – handedly created the crashed in the stock market.

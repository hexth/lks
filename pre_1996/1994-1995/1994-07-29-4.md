# Tun Hamid Omar should publicly declare his assets to answer the charges that he has acquired extraordinary wealth or he should resign as Chief Justice of Federal Court to save the judiciary from further embarrassment

Yesterday, DAP MP for Bukit Bintang, Wee Choo Keong, lodged his fourth report with the Anti-Corruption Agency against the Chief Justice of the Federal Court, Tun Hamid Omar for having assets beyond his known means of income.</u>

Tun Hamid Omar should publicly declare his assets to answer the charges that he has acquired extraordinary wealth or he should resign as Chief Justice of Federal Court to save the judiciary from further embarrassment.

Up to now, it is only the political leaders in government, like the Chief Minister of Malacca, Tan Sri Osman Aroff, who had been publicly accused of having unusual wealth disproportionate to their known means of income.

In other countries where the government is very serious about the fight against corruption, having unusual wealth is prima facie evidence of corruption unless the person concerned can explain the legitimate sources of such unusual sources.

DAP calls on the Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, to ask for the resignation of all political leaders and government officials who have unusual wealth disproportionate to their known sources of income and for which they could not publicly explain as having been derived from legitimate means, regardless of whether he is a Chief Minister, Mentri Besar or Chief Justice of the Federal Court.

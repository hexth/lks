# Election Commission should be ready to sell to the public the new 1994 electoral roll once it is certified on January 30

The Election Commission Secretary, Datuk Abdul Rashid, said yesterday that the 1994 electoral roll has been completed and will be gazetted on January 30.</u>

The reason why the new 1994 electoral roll is not being gazetted now is because of the Sulabayan state by-election in Sabah on January 28 – so that the 1993 electoral roll is still the effective and valid roll for the by-election.

As the Election Commission has already completed the new 1994 electoral roll and is waiting for January 30 to formally gazette it, the Election Commission should be ready to sell to the public the new 1994 electoral roll once it is certified.

Before the formal gazette on January 30, the Election Commission should supply to all political parties a set of draft 1994 electoral roll to enable them to help the Election Commission to check whether the new electoral roll is really clean and complete.

The DAP is particularly interested in ensuring that the new 1994 electoral roll is clean, honest and complete as we have handed over to the Election Commission a list of 30,000 duplicate voters on the 1993 electoral list – i.e. multiple registration of voters using the same identity card number, but with different names, addresses, race, sex and constituency.

# UN, NATO and the US have disappointed the world with their failure to launch air strikes at Serbs on expiry of deadline

The United Nations, NATO and the United States have disappointed the word with their failure to launch air strikes at Serbs following the expiry of their 10-day deadline against Serb artillery surrounding Sarajevo.</u>

In claiming that the air strike ultimatum had been a success and that the Serbs had complied with the deadline to pull out or surrender their guns overlooking Sarajevo, the onus is now squarely on the shoulders of UN, NATO and the United States which must take direct responsibility for every life lost or wounded in Sarajevo as a result of Serb shellfire after the deadline.

The UN, NATO an US must be made to understand that they, and not the Serbs, re being judged by mankind n history as to whether they have started the process to restore peace to Bosnia-Herzegovina by lifting the 22-month siege of Sarajevo, or whether thy have only given the Serbs a respite before they regroup and return to their grand design of ethnic cleansing and to make Sarajevo the capital of a Bosnian Serb state.

If the lifting of the 22-month siege of Sarajevo is to be the first step to peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, then the UN, NATO and US must act immediately to lift the siege by Serbs on six other Muslim enclaves which had been declared ‘safe areas’ by the United Nations and to remove all heavy Serb artillery from Bosnia-Herzegovina.

# DAP calls on ASEAN Governments to cancel the invitation to Myanmar to attend the ASEAN Ministerial meeting in Bangkok in July

DAP calls on ASEAN Governments to cancel the invitation to Myanmar to attend the ASEAN Ministerial meeting in Bangkok in July as guest of the Thai government.</u>

Such an invitation will tantamount to ASEAN condoning and endorsing the undemocratic and repressive policies of the ASEAN military junta, in particular in crushing the 1988 democracy uprising, the repudiation of the 1990 general elections verdict of the people of Myanmar, and the continued detention of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.

The State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) must not be given international respectability and legitimacy by being invited to the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting, which will be a great setback to the struggle of the people of Myanmar to restore democracy and a legitimate government in the country.

If the ASEAN Governments are not prepared to lift their fingers to help the people of Myanmar in their struggle to restore democracy, they should not give aid and succour to the SLORC by giving it support and recognition at the forthcoming ASEAN Ministerial meeting in Bangkok.

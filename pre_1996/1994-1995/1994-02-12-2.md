# Barisan Nasional component parties, PAS and PBS invited to nominate up to four representatives on the All-Party Parliamentary Committee on Parliamentary Honour and National Integrity

I have faxed invitations to the leaders of the Barisan Nasional component parties, PAS and PBS inviting them to nominate up to four representatives to serve on the All-Party Parliamentary Committee on Parliamentary Honour and National Integrity, which was established at a meeting in Parliament House on 8th February.</u>

The All-Party Parliamentary Committee on Parliamentary Honour and National Integrity was formed following allegations in the Australian mass media that Malaysian MPs had been bribed by Australian spies until four years ago.

These allegations tarnish the honour, credibility and integrity of Parliament as well as the nation, and constitute an unwarranted interference in the domestic affairs of the country.

As such, all MPs regardless of political affiliation should unite on a common national platform to defend Parliamen¬tary honour and national integrity from foreign mass media report.

In view of the urgency and gravity of the allegations, the leaders of the Barisan Nasional component parties, PAS and PBS had been asked to nominate their representatives before 20th February 1994.

This is because apart from the Australian mass media reports which accused Malaysian MPs who were government and UMNO politicians of receiving bribes from Australian spies until four years ago, in the past two weeks, the English mass media – both printed and electronic had also been full of reports about allegations of gross improprieties in the Malaysian purchase of British defence hardware and the Pergau hydroelectric dam.

These reports and allegations also tarnish the credibility, honour and integrity of Malaysia and they should also be immediately considered by the All-Party Parliamentary Committee on Parliamentary Honour and National Integrity.

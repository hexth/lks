Tuan Yang di-Pertua,                                                                                                    23rd April 1994
Dewan Rakyat,
Parliamen.

YB Tan Sri,

# Motion of urgent, definite public importante under standing Order 18(1) for Malaysian Parliament to provide international lead to demand resignation of Boutros Boutros-Ghali as United Nations Secretary-General for his abysmal impotence and failure to stop Serbian genocide of Bosnians or to uphold UN declaration of six Bosnian ‘safe areas’

This is to give notice under Standing Oder 18(2) that I wish to move the following motion to adjourn the House to discuss a matter of urgent, definite public importance, viz. for Malaysian Parliament to provide international lead to demand resignation of Boutros Boutros-Ghali as United Nations Secretary-General for his abysmal impotence and failure to stop Serbian genocide of Bosnians or to uphold UN declaration of six Bosnian ‘safe areas’</u>

“That under Standing Order 18(1), the House gives leave to the Ketua Pembangkang, YB Lim Kit Siang, to adjourn the House to discuss a matter of urgent, definite public importance, namely that the Malaysian Parliament provide international lead to demand the resignation of Boutros Boutros-Ghali as United Nations Secretary-General for his abysmal impotence and Failure to stop Serbian genocide of Bosnians or to uphold UN declaration of six Bosnian ‘safe areas’, for the following reasons:

Firstly, Boutros Boutros-Ghali has lost all moral authority and credibility to continue as UN Secretary-General as under his tenure, the Serb Aggressors had been allowed to perpetrate ethnic cleansing and genocide in Bosnia-Herzegovina causing the death of more than 200,000 people, while more than a million people had been made refugees more than a million people had been made refugees and tens of thousands of women raped;

Secondly, his impotence and failure as UN Secretary-General has been further compounded by his inability to secure and defend the six ‘safe areas’ in Bosnia declared by the carnage in Gorazde, which has been described as a ‘living hell’ by UN relief workers;

Thirdly, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, together with the United Nations Security Council and NATO must be held directly responsible for the over 500 killed and 1,500 wounded at Gorazde since the Serb on-slaught on the ‘safe area’ three weeks ago;

Fourthly, the impotence of Boutros Boutros-Ghali to implement UN resolutions to stop Serbian genocide in Bosnia-Herzegovina has also imperiled the lives of international UN peacekeeping in former Yugoslavia, as in the course of duty to the nation and in the cause of international peace;

Fifthly, Malaysian Parliament should provide the international lead to demand the resignation of Boutros Boutros-Ghali as UN Secretary-General not only to express international outrage at his impotence and failure but to create a new international condition for stronger international action to stop the Serbian ethnic cleansing and genocide of the Bosnians.”

Thank you.

Your sincerely,

(Lim Kit Siang)
Ketua Pembangkang

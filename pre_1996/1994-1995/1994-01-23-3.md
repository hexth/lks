# The international community should seriously consider removing Boutros Boutros – Ghali as UN secretary – general it he is not prepared to implement UN Security council resolution and order air strikes against the Serbian guns in Bosnia

The latest news of continuing carnage and atrocities form Bosnia-Herzegovina is that six children were killed and three seriously wounded in Serb-besieged sarajevi yesterday as two mortar bombs into their hilly residential district one kilometer from Serb lines.</u>

The Serbs must be condemned in the strongest possible terms for their continuing massacres and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia- Herzegovina , but such condemnations are no more adequate.

DAP fully supports the call by the Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Dr. Mahathir at the International Parliamentarian Conterence on Bosnia-Herzegovina in Kuala Lumpur yesterday that the United Nations Security Council must use political and diplomatic action backed by the use for force when necessary to resolve the tragedy in Bosnia – Herzegovina.

However , stronger action by the international community is needed it the UN security council and the UN secretary General , Boutros Boutros- Ghali are to be compelied to implement UN resolutions to end the Bosnian Holocaust or to lift the siege of Sarajevo and the Tuzla airport to permit unhindered flow of humanitarian assistance of food , medicine and other essentials.

The Bosnia- Herzegovina Holocaust is reaching a critical point of development with Western nations , like France , Britain and Canada trying to blackmail Bosnia to accept dishonorable peace terms with open talk at pull-out to their troops although they had failed in their mandate to implement UN resolutions on Bosnia- herzegivina.

France, Britain and Canada must be condemned for serious abdication of their international responsibility if they pulled out their troops from Bosnia- Herzegovina.

The time has come for the international community to seriously consider removing Boutros Boutros- Ghali as UN secretary – General it be continues to refuse to implement the UN resolutions and order air striked against Serbian guns in Bosnia.

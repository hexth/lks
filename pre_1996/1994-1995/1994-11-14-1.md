_Press statement by parliamentary opposition Leader , DAP  Secretary General and MP for Tanjong, Lim Kit Siang in Petaling Jaya on Monday, 14 November 1994:_

# I have asked my Lawyers to study whether defamation proceedings should also be instituted against the sun for publishing Keng Yaik’s defamatory statement.

I expect my lawyers, Karpal Singh and Co., to institute legal action against General President and Minister for Primary Industries Datuk Dr. Lim Keng Yaik, the new Sunday Times and the Straits Times Press for publishing a defamatory statement by Keng Yaik alleging that I had acted most dishonourably as well as discriminating against other DAP leaders in arranging a DAP scholarship for my son to pursue higher studies.</u>

Both my sons are incensed by the such a lie as there is no truth whatsoever that they had received a single cent from the DAP as scholarship for their university studies. In Fact, both of them, one from Monash University and the other from Melbourne University had to slog and work as factory hands during university vacations.

I am also asking my lawyers to study whether legal action should be instituted against the sun for publishing Keng Yaik’s defamatory on Sunday.

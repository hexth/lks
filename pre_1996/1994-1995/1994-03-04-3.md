# With the denial by Wimpey International that it had paid bribes to Malaysian politicians, Mahathir should file legal action against London Sunday Times

British company, Wimpey International has denied in last weekâ€™s BUILDING magazine in Britain that it had. paid bribes to Malaysian politicians in 1985 in pursuit of a billion-ringgit contract to build an aluminium smelter.</u>

The spokesman of Wimpey International said that there were no bribes involved and no work resulted.

With this denial by Wimpey International, the Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, should have no hesitation to file legal action against London Sunday Times which had reported that Wimpey had approved US$50,000 as first payment of US$150,000 to a middleman to deposit in a Swiss bank account for Mahathir.

This legal action is all the more necessary as the Editor of the London Sunday Times, Andrew Neil, has said that he would not apologise for the story.

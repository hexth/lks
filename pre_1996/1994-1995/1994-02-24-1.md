# I will send the Inspector-General of Police, Tan Sri Rahim Noor, a copy of the Canberra Times report dated February 3 stating that it is government and UMNO politicians and MPs who had been receiving bribes from ASIS agents and not opposition politicians

The Inspector-General of Police, Tan Sri Abdul Rahim Mohamed Noor, said yesterday that the police are trying to get certain parties in Australia to help in investigations on allegations that certain Malaysian opposition politicians were bribed by the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS).</u>

He said that the investigations would take time as police were trying to get to the bottom of the matter.

What is shocking is that the IGP seems to be behind-time and unaware of the Canberra Times report of February 3 that those who had been accepting bribes from ASIS agents until four years ago were government and UMNO politicians and MPs and not opposition politicians as alleged by the Sydney Sunday Telegraph of January 16.

I will send a copy of the Canberra Times report of February 3 to Tan Sri Rahim Nor, and I will ask him whether the police have started investigations into the Canberra Times report or whether he wanted a police report to be lodged first.

In the case of the Sydney Sunday Telegraph report of January 16, the police itself lodged a police report to enable police investigations to begin. Will the Police lodge a police report itself in connection with the Canberra Times report of February 3, or does it want others to lodge the police report?

If the police is not prepared to lodge a police report itself in connection with the Canberra Times report to enable it to begin police investigations, I am prepared to lodge such a police report.

The All-Party Parliamentary Committee on Parliamentary Honour and National Integrity will hold its first meeting in early March

The All-Party Parliamentary Committee on Parliamentary Honour and National Integrity will hold its first meeting in early March.

The All-Party Parliamentary Committee on Parliamentary Honour and National Integrity will ask for the assistance of the IGP, especially as Tan Sri Rahim Noor had said early this month that preliminary police investigations had found some evidence to back up the Australian spies’ bribery allegations implicating opposition politicians.

I will propose at the first meeting of the All-Party Parliamentary Committee on Parliamentary Honour and National Integrity that the IGP be invited to appear before the Committee to give a briefing of the nature of the preliminary investigations which the Police had carried out which had found some evidence to back up the Australian spies’ bribery allegations implicating opposition politicians, and whether such preliminary Police investigations had found any evidence that UMNO politicians and MPs had been receiving ASIS bribes until four years ago.

Australian Government decision to establish a judicial inquiry into ASIS spy activities in foreign countries most welcome but it must be a public inquiry

The Australian Government decision, as announced by the Foreign Minister Gareth Evans yesterday, to establish a judicial inquiry into ASIS spy activities in foreign countries is most welcome - but it must be a public inquiry so that it could clear the names and reputations of foreign politicians and countries which had been implicated in recent Australian mass media reports.

The All-Party Parliamentary Committee on Parliamentary Honour and National Integrity is prepared to give the fullest co¬operation to the Australian judicial inquiry into the ASIS activities with regard to allegations that Malaysian politicians and MPs had been accepting bribes from ASIS agents until four years ago.

The All-Party Parliamentary Committee on Parliamentary Honour and National Integrity will consider sending members to Australia to attend the hearings of the Australian judicial inquiry when it deals with ASIS activities and operations in Malaysia - in particular on the bribing of Malaysian politicians and MPs.

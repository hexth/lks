# Anwar Ibrahim should direct Kuala Lumpur City Hall not to practice double standards in the freeze on all hillside high-rise buildings following the Highland Towers Collapse Disaster

Deputy Prime Minister , Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim , should direct the Kuala Lumpur City Hall not to practice double standards in the freeze on all hillside high-rise buildings following the Highlands Towers Collapse Disaster – until independent consultants certify the safety on the projects.</u>

It is to be expected that the other developers are up in arms against the Kuala Lumpur City Hall for allowing work to continue at the 10-storey Plaza Phoenix project, which included leveling the hill situated at the 10th kilometer Jalan Cheras.

The project  is being undertaken by Manalom Management Sdn. Bhd ,a subsidiary of Sarawak based KBC Group of campanies.

It would appear that the KL City Hall has found a ‘loophole’ the Cabinet order to freeze all hillside high-side building developments to allow the Plaza Phoenix project to continue work.

One reason why Highland Towers collapsed , killing over 70 people , must be because of the ability to find ‘loopholes’ in laws , regulations and directives meant to protect public interest , and it is most shocking if so soon after the Highland Towers Tragedy , corporate civic responsibility is again being sacrificed to profits and greed.

# A new international campaign to save the Bosnians from Serb genocide urgently needed as the West may be on the verge of abandoning the Bosnians completely and capitulating to Serb aggression and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia-Herzegovina

A new international campaign to save the Bosnians from Serb genocide is urgently needed as the West may be on the verge of abandoning the Bosnians completely and capitulating 'to Serb aggression and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</u>

The complete loss of political will of the United Nations Security Council and Western countries to use their militiary might to stand up for humanity and fight against the Serbian holocaust against the Bosnians is clearly reflected by the French announcement of possible cuts in its 6,000-strong force in former Yugoslavia and the British ultimatum to withdraw its 3,000 troops in Bosnia unless the warring factions settled their differences in two months.

The British and the French Governments are not only setting a modern example of appeasement and capitulation to genocide and war crimes, but are forfeiting the right to continue to be permanent members of United Nations Security Council by their international cowardice.

In fact, this attitude of appeasement and capitulation to Serbian atrocities and genocide had been very apparent a month ago, when a senior UN spokesman far UN special envoy, Yasushi Akashi had declared in Zagreb in the middle of April that the United Nations was seriously considering a complete withdrawal of its troops from Bosnia in reaction to the intransigence of Serb forces who were on the verge of capturing Gorazde.

Akashi had gone on public record to say that it would be meaningless for the UN Protection Force (UNprofor) to remain in Bosnia if the Serbs do not co-operate.

This will be a policy to reward the Serbian agressors while allowing the Bosnians victims to be butchered and decimat¬ed.

Time is running out for the Bosnians in Bosnia-¬Herzegovina unless a new international campaign to forestall a UN and Western capitulation and sell-out to the Serbian aggressors is immediately launched.

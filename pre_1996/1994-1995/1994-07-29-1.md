# Liong Sik should explain why MCA is not prepared to hand over donations directly to Chinese Independent Secondary Schools or Dong Jiao Zhong if it has no ulterior motive

The joint central committee meeting of the MCA, MCA Youth and MCA Wanita a few days ago decided to keep donations from the Chinese community for the Chinese Independent Secondary Schools in its Hauren Fund instead of handing them directly to the Chinese Independent Secondary Schools.</u>

This decision of the MCA leadership goes against the wishes of the Chinese community which wants MCA to hand the donations directly to Chinese Independent Secondary Schools or to Dong Jiao Zhong.

The Chinese community does not want MCA to keep these donations in its Hauren Fund for two reasons:

Firstly, to prevent MCA from using the donations for Chinese Independent Secondary Schools in Hauren Fund as an instrument to further its political objective to take over the Chinese Independent Secondary Schools and Dong Jiao Zhong, to fulfill its secret agenda to ‘MCA-ise’ Chinese Independent Secondary Schools or to Dong Jiao Zhong; and

Secondly, to ensure that there would be no misappropriation of public funds, criminal breach of trust and other abuses of power, as the MCA leadership has the worst history of all political parties in Malaysia on this score as seen by the list of MCA leaders – including a MCA President, a MCA Youth Leader and a MCA Deputy Minister – who had been convicted and jailed for criminal breach of trust.

After all, the MCA scandal concerning the Chan Ming Thiam Education Fund is well-known to the Chinese community.

The MCA President, Datuk Dr. Ling Liong Sik , should explain why the MCA is not prepared to hand over the donations directly to the Chinese Independent Secondary Schools or to Dong Jiao Zhong if has no ulterior motive to use the money to ‘MCA-ise’ Chinese Independent Secondary Schools and eventually Dong Jiao Zong.

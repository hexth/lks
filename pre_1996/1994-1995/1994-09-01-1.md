# DAP deplores ‘debth threat’ to Dr. Ibrahim Saad and calls on everyone not to use threats of force or violence in any struggle for people’s rights

I am shocked by newspaper reports that the Penang Deputy Chief Minister, Dr. Ihrahim Saad, has received a phone ‘death threat’ where the caller threatened to ‘shoot’ Dr. Ibrahim if he set foot in the Kampong Makam area in Penang.</u>

I may not see ‘eye-to-eye’ with Dr. Ibrahim on many issued affecting the people of Penang, but I will defend Dr. Ibrahim’s right not to be threatened or harmed physically including ‘death threats’ through the telephone.

DAP deplores ‘death threat’ to Dr. Ibrahim or to anyone, whether in government or in opposition, and calls on everyone not to use threats of force or violence in any struggle for people’s rights.

As one who had received ‘death threats’ from callers through the telephone before, we should not allow such ‘death-threat culture’ to be promoted in Malaysia.

# The United Nations must use air power of the United States and Nato to ensure that Sarajevo and the six other mainly Muslim enclaves in Bosnia are ‘safe areas ‘ which it proclaimed last year and not ‘ death traps’

Last year , the united Nations designated the Bosnian Capatil , Sarajevo and six other mainly Muslin enclaves in Bosnia , such as Srebrencia and Tuzla , as “safe areas” to be protected from strangulation by Bosnian Serb Forces.</u>

However there is nothing safe about Sarajove or the six other safe havens as illustrated by the gruesome fact that more than 55 people had been killed in the Bosnian capital amid heavy Serb shelling over the past 10 days.

In Sarajevo and the other six areas , there is daily toll of the latest casualties from the long Bosnian agony – adding to the long list of the dead ,wounded and displace in bosnia.

The United Nations must use air power of the United States and Nato to ensure that Sarajevo and the six othes safe areas in Bosnia do not become death traps and are really safe havens.

If the United States and Noto are not prepared to make use of their undisputes air superiority to silence the Serbian guns in Bosnia , then the rest of the international community should be ready to assemble an international air force under the auspices of the United Nations to implement the UM resolution on making Sarajevo and the other six Muslim enclaves in bosnia as truly “safe areas”.

# DAP calls on Indonesian Government to release well-known poet, W. S. Rendra and 4O others who were detained for protesting against the ban on three Indonesian journals, Tempo, Editor and DeTik

		DAP calls on the Indonesian Government to immediately release well known poet, W.S. Rendra and 40 others who were detained yesterday for protesting against the ban on three Indonesian journals, Tempo, Editor and DeTik.</u>

		The military brutality against the unarmed protestors yesterday must be condemned in the strongest possible terms by all civilized communities.

		The detention of Rendra and 40 others, as well as the ban on the three Indonesian magazines, are double blows against human rights In Indonesia the freedom of expression as well and the liberty of the individual.

		Malaysians must express their support and solidarity for Rendra and the three Indonesian journals, so that the Indonesians fighting for greater democratisation in their country know that they are not alone in their struggle and aspirations.

		The Malaysian Government should also register its concern and protest against the detention of Rendra and the ban on the three Indonesian journals, as these undemocratic developments have seriously blotted the human rights record of ASEAN in International arena.

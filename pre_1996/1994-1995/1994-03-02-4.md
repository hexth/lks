# The Government’s directive to hotels to stop screening Vision Pour programmes a retrograde step

The Government’s directive to hotels to stop screening Vision Four programmes is a retrograde step which will not enhance tourism in Malaysia.</u>

Unless the Information Ministry has grounds for objecting to the Vision Four programmes, either on anti-national, security or pornographic grounds, the Government should not stop-hotels from screening Vision Four programmes if they ester to foreign tourists by giving them more choice of entertainment.

If the only legal hurdle is the ruling of the Attorney-General’s Chambers that such hotel screening constitute a public viewing and therefore needed a licence, then suitable amendments could be made to the Broadcasting Act 1988 in the April Parliametnary meeting.

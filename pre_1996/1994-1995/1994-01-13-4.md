# The United Nations should use the Bosniam Serb refusal to open the key Muslim airport of Tuzla for relief flights to launch air strikes to silence the Serbian quns in Bosnia

The Bosnian Serbs have continued to defy the international community in oits latest refusal to open the jey muslim airport to Tuzla for relief flights.</u>

The United Nations should end its policy of drift , facklesness and empty threats and should use the Bosnian serb refusal to open to Tuzla airport to launch air stickes to silence the Serbiann guns in Bosnia.

The UN had warned recently that many people were near death in central Bosnia as last month less than 18 percent of the relief supplies had been able to reach the 1.2 million people in centrel Bosnia , who are wholly dependent on outside aid to survive the winter.

The security council proclaimed the Bosnian Capital, Sarajevo , as a safe haven  last May , at the United Nations had been totally resolution and Sarajevi and its 300,000 inhabitants were the target of intense Serb shelling since before Chritmas

Serb gunners on mountain towering over Sarajevo have killed or wounded more than 65,000 residents since staring a siege of the capital 21 months ago.

The cost in human lives and suffering  in the genocide and ethic cleansing in Bosnia had been  phenomenal , with a quarter of a million deaths , another quarter of a million crippled , while 60 percent of the pre-war population of 4.35 million forced to flee their homes.

The Bosnia Holocaust is the greatest crisis for mankind on the eve of the 21st century and unless the international community takes courageous action to end the earnage and atrocities in the heart of Europe , it will  be a bad omen for the new century.

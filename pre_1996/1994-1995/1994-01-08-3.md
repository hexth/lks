DAP calls for convening of emergency Penang State Assembly meeting to debate the Hotel Metropole scandal and to set up Public Inquiry Commission 

DAP calls on the Penang Chief Minister , Dr. Koh Tsu Koon , to convene an emergency meeting of the Penang State Assembly to debate the Hotel Metropole heritage building demolition Scandal and o set up a Public Inquiry Commission.

The MPPP had acted in a very undemocratic manner, disregarding the principles of accountability and transparency in its entire decision – making process, including the question of conservation of heritage buildings.

In early December , when Tan Gim Hwa told the press that the MPPP had identified anout 10 historical buildings along Jalan Sultan Admad Shah ( which means removing about 10 others from the MPPP’ s list of 20 heritage buildings and sites ), he said that the council would wrote officially to the owners of the historical buildings to inform them of the conversation plan.

Why wasn’t there any public consultation before the MPPP decided to review and cut doen its 1989 list of 20 conservation buildings and sites in Jalan Sultan Ahmad Shah? Why was the whole process shrouded in secrecy , as if Tan Gim Hwa had never heard of the principles of accountability and transparency?

# Semangat 46 and PAS MPs have agreed to attend the meeting of MPs in Parliament tomorrow on the Australian allegation that MPs had been bribed by Australian spies until four years ago

Semangat 46 and PAS MPs have agreed to attend the meeting of MPs in Parliament tomorrow on the Australian allegation that Malaysian MPs have been bribed by Australian spies until four years ago.</u>

Semangat 46 President, Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, will attend the meeting of MPs for all political parties and will speak at the meeting,

If tomorrow, all Cabinet Ministers - including the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister - and all MPs, regard less of party, whether UMNO, MCA, MIC, Gerakan, SUPP, PBB, PBDS, DAP, Semangat 46, PAS or PBS, could meet on a common platform to defend the honour of Malaysian Parliament and the integrity of Malaysia, it will be a historic occasion in the 37-year history of Malaysian nationhood.

Malaysian politicians would at last have shown to the nation and the world that they have become mature and responsible politicians who could put national interests above party interest.

If the Malaysian MPs could speak with one voice to demand that the Australian Government should reveal all details of the ASIS bribery of Malaysian MPs, and the names of the government and UMNO politicians who had received the bribes until four years ago, the Australian Prime Minister, Paul Keating and his Government would find it difficulty to stonewall Malaysian demands by using the excuse that it had been their government policy not to comment on intelligence and security reports.

Australian Government must apologise and give an undertaking that in future ASIS agents would not interfere in domestic affairs in Malaysia

Such an excuse is unacceptable where the honour of Parliament and the integrity of Malaysia had been besmirched by the Australian authorities - as the Australian Government must accept full responsibility for the activities of ASIS and its former intelligence agents.

The Australian Government's claim to want to be part of Asia must be suspect if it is not prepared to fully and honourably confess to all its ASIS operations in Malaysia and the bribery of government politicians and MPs, punish the ASIS officers or agents responsible, tender an unconditional apology and give an undertaking that in future, ASIS or any other of its intelligence agency would not interfere in the domestic affairs of Malaysia.

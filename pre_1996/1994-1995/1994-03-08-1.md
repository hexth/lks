The DAP takes a very serious view of the numerous complaints and allegations about MBf malpractices, irregularities and improprieties and will continue with our great traditional role to protect the interests of the small man and woman against the power and vested interests of the big institutions and corporations.

As a first step, the DAP Committee investigating into MBf malpractices, irregularities and improprieties invite public complaints about MBf malpractices, irregularities and improprieties, which should be submitted to the Chairman of the Committee, Lim Kit Siang, c/o DAP Headquarters, No. 24, Jalan 20/9, Paramount Garden, 46300 Petaling Jaya or Telephone 03-7578022/7578127 or to any member of the Committee.

The DAP Committee can assure the public that without their agreement, the identity of the complainants would be kept strictly confidential.

The next step would be for the DAP Committee on MBf malpractices, irregularities and improprieties to decide on the modus operandi to expose the MBf malpractices, irregularities and improprieties after they had been identified, including actions that should be taken by the aothorities concerned to protect the public interest.

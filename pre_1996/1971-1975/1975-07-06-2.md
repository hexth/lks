# DAP on the Ministries of Education and Fate motion broadcasting to introduce educational programmes’ in Chinese and Tamil for students in Chinese and Tamil Primary Schools.

The educational T.V. programmes that are new telecast over T.V. Malaysia fer school students are only in Bahasa Malaysia and English.

The commission in presenting educational programmes in Chinese and Tamil languages is clearly inconsistent with the Government’s stated intention not to convert Chinese and Tamil primary schools in socerdance with Clause 21 (2) of the 1961 Education Act.</u>

If the Barisan National Government is genuine in wanting to give equal treatment in all primary schools whether National schools on National type primary schools, then the Government should not ignore the needs of the Chinese and Tamil primary sschools students and extend educational TV programme to include Chinese and Tamil TV lessons as well.

The DAP calls on the Ministry of Education and that of Information and Broadcasting to immedistely introduce Chinese and Tamil TV programme so that Chinese and Tamil primary schools students are nor discriminated against in any field of education.

The DAP also calls on all the MCA, Gerakan and MIC Ministers, Assistant Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries and Members of Parliament to declare their stand on this matter.

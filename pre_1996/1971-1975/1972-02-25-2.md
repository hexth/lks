# DAP calls for immediate recognition of Bangladesh by Malaysia

The independent state of Bangladesh is an international fact of life, and more and more countries, such as British, France, Netherlands, Soviet Union, Japan, Burma, have accorded it recognition.

Even the Asean nations like Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines have accorded recognition to Bangladesh. Indonesia has in principle agreed to recognise Bangladesh, and is waiting for an opportune moment to announce its recognition – which may be any time next week. Malaysia is the only ASEAN country which has refused to recognise Bangladesh.

It does not matter to Bangladesh whether Malaysia recognises her or not, but it matters to Malaysia’s credibility as a nation with an independent foreign policy and her future relations with a near neighbour which is the second largest Muslim nation with her 70 million people that she should immediately recognise Bangla Desh.

The DAP calls on the Government of Malaysia to recognise Bangladesh immediately, and establish ties with the new Asian state. We also call on the Malaysian Government to give all help and assistance to the Government of Bangladesh in its present task of reconstruction and development of a shattered economy and rehabilitation of displaced persons.

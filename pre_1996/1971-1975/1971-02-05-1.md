Motion One: that this House calls on the Government to institute an independent commission of inquiry to require into the true causes of the May 13 racial riots and its spread, and to draw the correct lessons from this national tragedy, and to make recommendations to the people and government on ways and means to prevent such a recurrence.

Motion Two: that this House (i) AFFIRMS that parliamentary democracy is the most suitable form of political system for a multi-racial, multi-cultural, multi-lingual and multi-religious nation like Malaysia;</u>

	(ii)DEPLORED the unjustified suspension of Parliament on May 18, 1969; and 

	(iii)CALLS on the Government to take all steps to make parliamentary democracy meaningful in Malaysia by withdrawing all undemocratic measures and actions.

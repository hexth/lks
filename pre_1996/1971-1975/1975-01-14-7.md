# Winds of Change Blowing in the Countryside

The National Frontâ€™s general elections victory in the August 1974 general election cannot hide the fact that the winds of change are beginning to blow in the countryside.

The student demonstrations in Kuala Lumpur at the end of last year stemmed basically from socio-economic factors, and illustrated a growing swareness of the fundamental.

Unless the National Front government make radical changes in its socio-economic policies, and aim at the elimination of poverty among all Malaysians and not the creation of a new rich class, class differences and antagonisms will deepen and increase.

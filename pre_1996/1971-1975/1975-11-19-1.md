Yang Berhormat 
Tan Sri Yang di-Pertua,
Dewan Rakyat/ Parlimen,
Kuala Lumpur.

Dear Tan Sri,

Under Standing Orders 18, I am giving notice to seek leave of the House to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, the motion to read:</u>

“That this House under Standing Orders 18(1) adjourn the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, to wit, the loss of an important State document, namely the original copy of the Emergency (Essential Powers) Ordinance No. 1 of the 1969, bearing the signature of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, as has just been disclosed by the Chief Secretary to the Government Tan Sri  Abdul Kadir Samsuddin in a High Court proceeding;

Agreeing that this matter is a definite matter concerning the loss of a Basis State document, which shatters public confidence in the security of the processes of government at the very apex;

An urgent matter, requiring immediate Parliamentary attention to regain public confidence in the security of State and National documents, and the entire processes of government;

And of Public Importance, as it is by virtue of this Ordinance which allows for the making of any Essential Regulation which the Yang di-Pertuan Agong consider “desirable or expedient for securing the public safety, the defence of Malaysia, the maintenance of public order and of supplies and services essential to the life of the community” that the Government had passed a host of Regulations of far-reaching consequences to the lives and liberties of (Rukun Tetangga) Regulations and Pasiontial (Security Cases) Regulations warranting not only Parliamentary attention and debate to ascertain how such a loss of a Basic Government Document happened, but also the institution of a special Inquiry into such a loss and to tighten up security measures in the very hub of government processes.”

Thank you.

Yours sincerely,

(Lim Kit Siang)
Opposition Leader 
And 
H.P for Kota Melaka

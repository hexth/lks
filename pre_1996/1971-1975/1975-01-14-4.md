# DAP want Municipal rates increases removed 

The National Front Government must prove that it is on the ride of the poor, and not the agents of the rich. The Malacca Municipalityâ€™s unjustified increase of garbage and conservancy rates by some 100% is another example of its failure to understand the hardships of the poor, especially at this time of unending inflation. Indeed, if the Municipality cannot help the poor to lessen their economic burdens, the least they expect of the Municipality is that it would not increase their hardships.

The Malacca Municipality should not ignore the pleas and hardships of the people of Malacca and should without any more delay withdraw the increases in Municipal rates.

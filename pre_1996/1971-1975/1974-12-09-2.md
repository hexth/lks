# Motion by M.P. for Kota Melaka, Lim Kit Siang, in the Dewan Rakyat on 9.12.1974

I rise under Standing Orders 18 (1) to apply for the adjournment of this House to discuss a matter of urgent, definite public importance, namely:

“That this House expresses regret at the mishandling of the student demonstrations concerning the legitimate grievances of tear gas which provoked various incidents, the arrest of university lecturers of Malaya, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaya, Institute Technology MARA (ITM), Institute Teknologi Kebangsaan (ITK) and CALL on the government to set up a commission inquiry to investigate into the student demands and to release immediately all the arrested university lecture and student leaders”</u>

This matter is definite as it concerns the whole matter of the student is arising from the Baling hunger demonstrations, the confrontation between the student and the police, the mass arrests and campus takeover by the police which could have been avoided by proper police handling right from the beginning; and which continues to be a serious national problem which should engage the attention of Parliament;

It is public and urgent because unless a satisfactory solution which takes into consideration the legitimate grievances of the students concerning the socio-economic hardship of the people at this period of stagflation is found, without features of repression and violation of university academic freedom, this problem will continue, especially in view of worsening economic conditions inside and outside the country.

I am aware that there are charges before the courts, but I submit that this debate will not be sub judice as it is not necessary to refer to the court charges at all.

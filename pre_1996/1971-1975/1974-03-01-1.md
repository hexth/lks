# Test whether MCA Ministers match deeds with words

MCA Ministers and leaders are fond of making rosy promises and grand pledges which they have no intention of fulfilling.

Last month, at a Selangor MCA branch reception in Ulu Klang, the Minister of Health and Selangor MCA Chairman, Tan Sri Lee Siok Yew, asked the people to instantly report any instance of unfairness of injustice by any government public officer.</u>

He declared: “I guarantee that the MCA will meet the legal fees and must eliminate those public servants who wrongly administer government policy.”

I am going to take up Tan Sri Lee Siok Yew’s public invitation, so that the people in Malaysia can see whether the solemn pledge of MCA Ministers and leaders are worth anything at all.

It is general knowledge by now that from July 21 to August 20 1973, because of the maladministration and negligence of the Malacca Hospital, many patients died of poisoning caused by the breakdown of the autoclave plant.

This is a gross injustice to the families who have lost their wage earners, or loved ones, who need not have died, if there is a proper standard of hospital care and administration.

On behalf of the families of all those relatives who died in Malacca Hospital from July 21 to August 20, 1973, as a result of autoclave poisoning, I suggest that the MCA provide the legal fees to represent them in court to sue the Malacca Hospital authorities for negligence and maladministration, and to secure compensation from the government.

I await Tan Sri Lee Siok Yew’s reply and MCA action.

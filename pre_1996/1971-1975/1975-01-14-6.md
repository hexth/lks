# Stateless problem of red identity holders

1974 also saw the establishment of diplomatic relations between Malaysia and the People’s Republic of China, a goal advocated by the DAP since our formation in 1966. It is our hope that with the exchange of ambassadors between Malaysia and the People’s Republic of China, the Malaysian Government would immediate act to resolve the problem of stateless of 300,000 persons of Chinese origin in Malaysia, and confer citizenship to all those with the requisite citizenship qualifications.

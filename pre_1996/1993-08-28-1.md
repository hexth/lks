# DAP calls on Prime Minister, datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamed to convene an emergency session of Parliament to debate the cover up of the RM150 million MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal by the Anti-Corruption Agency and the Attorney-General

DAP calls on the Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamed, to convene an emergency session of Parliament to debate the cover up of the RM150 billion MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal by the Anti-Corruption Agency and the Attorney-General, Tan Sri Abu Talib Othman.</u>

Instead of getting to the bottom of the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal and allow Malaysians to understand the true story of the RM150 million scandal which defrauded the 66,000 MAIKA Telekom shareholders, the ACA and the Attorney-General have raised even more questions by their cover up.

In fact, the cover up of the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal by the ACA and the Attorney-General after 17 months of investigation has become an even greater scandal than the original MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal itself!

Following the cover up of the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal by the ACA and the Attorney-General, my unprecedented suspension from Parliament for seven months last year at the height of my expose of the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal can be seen in its correct perspective.

ACA is only a shield to protect corruption, breach of trust, abuses of power and unethical practices in high political places
If the authorities-that-be are prepared to go to the unprecedented and undemocratic lengths of suspending the Parliamentary Opposition Leader for seven months to shut him out from Parliament on the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking shares scandal, should it be any surprise that the 17 month investigation by the ACA was a mere cover up exercise?

I had asked inside and outside Parliament last year whether the ACA is a word to fight corruption, breach of trust, abuses of power and unethical practices in high political places or a shield to protect such corruption, breach of trust, abuses of power and unethical practices.
From the outsome of the 17 month ACA investigation and its cover up of the scandal, the answer to my question is very clear: the ACA is nothing but a shield to protect corruption, breach of trust, abuses of power and unethical practices in high political places.

If ACA is not prepared to give full and detailed report of its 17 months investigation into the MAIAK Telekom shares hijacking scandal, then it might as well stand for Accept Corruption Agency henceforth

ACA owes the Malaysian public and nation a responsibility to prove that its 17 month investigation into the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal had not been a farce and mammoth waste of public funds.

For instance, ACA must give full details to explain the contradictions and discrepancies in its findings which proved that the MTC President and Minister for Energy, Telecommunications and Posts, Datuk Seri Sammy Vellu had lied in his Tell All Press Conference on May 15, 1992 that all the proceeds from the sale of 8.92 million Telekom shares by the three proxy companies, Advance Personal Computers Sdn Bhd, S,B. Management Sdn Bhd and Clearway Sdn Bhd had been channeled to TAFE College.

It reflects very badly on the ACA that it did even dare to point out that from its findings, Sammy Vellu’s claim that every single sen from the sale of 8.92 million Telekom shares totalling RM7.168 million had been chanelled to the MTED in three instalments of RM2.318 million in November 1990, RM100,000 in December 1990 and RM4.75 million in March/April 1992 was untrue. Nobody would have realized this if I had not pointed out in my press conference statements yesterday.

If the ACA is not prepared to give the a full and detailed report of the results of the 17 month investigation, making public all documentation, facts and figures, then the ACA might as well stand for Accept Corruption Agency henceforth!
Attorney-General should explain whether the failure to prosecute MIC leaders for assault and violence was because the government had decided on a cover up exercise =right from the beginning

In this connection, the Attorney-General, Tan Sri Abu Talib should explain whether the failure to prosecute MIC leaders for assault and violence against MAIKA Telekom shareholders and others in connection with their protest at the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal was because the government had decided on a cover up exercise right from the beginning.

I met the Inspector-General of Police last September in connection with the spate of gangsterism, violence and lawlessness by MIC leaders I n May and June of last year, where the following assaults took place publicly in the presence of the police:

•	The assault of MAIKA shareholders peacefully picketing outside the MAIKA Headquarter on May 13, 1992. The MIC Selangor Assemblyman for Seri Cahaya, S Sivalingam, led the assaults in full view of the police.

•	The disruption of a DAP MAIKA Telekom ceramah in Port Klang on May 31 by Selangor MIC State Executive Councillor, Datuk TM Thurai Selangor MIC Assemblymen S Sellathevan, MIC Senator Krishnan together with over a hundred followers who openly defied the police and


•	The assault of a Perak DAP State Committee Member, Rajamanickam, by Sungei Siput MIC local leaders on June 5, 1992 in connection with a DAP MAIKA ceramah, again in the presence of the police.

The Yang Di Pertuan Agong, the Prime Minister and the Government had repeatedly declared that the rule of law of prevails in Malaysia and that the laws in the country must be adhered to and respected by all.

However, the various aspects of the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal have proved otherwise and demonstrated that the rule of law prevails only for the common-folks, while there is another law for those in high political places.

As a place, public confidence not only in the ACA, the Attorney-General but in the entire government and the rule of law have been greatly shaken by the scandal of the cover up after the 17 month ACA investigation into the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal.
This is the reason why Mahathir should convene an emergency meeting of Parliament to restore public confidence in the ACA, the Attorney-General, the government and the rule of law.

_Speech by Parliamentary Opposition Leader, DAP Secretary-General and MP for Kota Melaka, Lim Kit Siang, at the fifth meeting of the Malacca DAP State ‘Save Bukit China’ Committee at Malacca DAP premises on Tuesday, 14.8.1984 at 8 p.m._

# Call on people of Malacca to produce 50,000 signatures in the 200,000 ‘Save Bukit China’ Mass Signature Campaign to Save Bukit China

The ‘Save Bukit China’ mass signature campaign launched by the DAP is a nation-wide campaign, to get the support of Malaysians of all races, religions and in all States, to preserve the 500-year-old symbol of the first Sino-Malay co-operation and friendship in Malaysia as a national heritage, and to protect the cultural roots and the historic contribution of the Chinese to the building of present-day Malaysia.</u>

I had said during the first launching a week ago that our initial target is 200,000 signatures, which would make it the biggest and most successful signature campaign in Malaysian history.

Malacca, where the whole issue of Bukit China originated, should be able to play a leading role, not only in the campaign to save Bukit China, but also in the ‘Save Bukit China’ Mass Signature Campaign. I call on the people of Malacca to respond enthusiastically to sign as well to help in the signature campaign. Malacca should aim to get 50,000 signatures, and I am confident that this figure is achievable in Malacca if every Malaccan understand the significance and far-reaching implications of the government’s move to forcibly level and develop 80 per cent of Bukit China.

If Malacca can come up with 50,000 signatures in the 200,000 ‘Save Bukit China’ Mass Signature Campaign, then we can expect other states to match the performance of Malacca, and considering that Malacca is only a small state as compared to other states like Perak, Penang, Selanngor, Johore, FT, Pahang or even Negri Sembilan, then we can expect the initial target of 200,000 signatures to be exceeded.

Call on people of Malacca and other states to make the August 19 ‘Walk or Jog To Save Bukit China’ more successful than the July 8 Pray and Visit Bukit China to tell the Malacca Chief Minister of the people’s stand

On August 19 (Sunday) at 8 a.m., the DAP is organising a ‘Walk or Jog to Save Bukit China’, where all participants should wear the ‘Save Bukit China’ T-shirt, to demonstrate their concern for the preservation of Bukit China from forcible government levelling and development.

I call on the people of Malacca and other states to make the Sunday’s ‘Walk or Jog to Save Bukit China’ even more successful than the July 8 Prayer at Poh San Temple and Visit Bukit China, to let the Malacca Chief Minister know of the people’s strong objection to his so-called three options for the development of Bukit China, which is actually no option, which he announced at the Malacca State Assembly on July 23.

If on August 19, Bukit China teems with people wearing the ‘Save Bukit China’ T-shirt, walking or jogging, which is a healthy pursuit, it will send a very loud and powerful message not only to the Malacca Chief Minister but to all Federal leaders that the people are strongly opposed to the government plan to level and develop Bukit China.

August 19 National Meeting of DAP ‘Save Bukit China’ national and state officials and members would be an important policy meeting

After the ‘Walk or Jog to Save Bukit China’, the DAP will hold the third policy meeting on the campaign to Save Bukit China in the last two months. The first one was held at the 3,000-People Dinner Malacca on July 8 where the DAP explained the long-term implications of the Bukit China issue; the second one was held at the ‘Save Bukit’ Public Ceramah on July in Malacca where the DAP exposed the conspiracy of some MCA political leaders to work closely with the Malacca Chief Minister to achieve the plan to level and develop Bukit China. The third will be the National Meeting of DAP ‘Save Bukit China’ national and state officials and members, where I will be giving my third specialised speech on Bukit China, entitled: A Review of the Campaign to Save Bukit China.

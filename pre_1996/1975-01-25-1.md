_Statement issued by Sdr. Lim Kit Siang, DAP Secretary General and MP for Kota Melaka in Melaka to-day:_

# The DAP condemns the arrest under the Internal Security Act of Abdul Rasak Ahmad, Chairman of the Johore PSRM.

The DAP opposes the use of arbitrary powers of arrest without trial against critics and opponents of the government and is deeply concerned at the growing trend of repression through the massive use of the Internal Security Act as evidenced by mass arrests recently.

The DAP is prepared to work with other political parties and all civil rights organisations on the common question of opposing arrests under the Internal Security Act so as to ensure that there is a more meaningful democratic system in Malaysia.

# DAP fully supports Tun Hussein Onn’s proposal.

I fully support the proposal by former Prime Minister, Tun Hussein Onn for necessary legislative action in order to enable
the BMF loan scandal culprits to be charged and prosecuted in the country.</u>

I hope that the Prime Minister, Dr. Mahathir Mohamad would
take up the suggestion and in the forth coming meeting of Parliament
in July necessitate a Bill to bring this into effect.

The long delay in coming out with something concrete and
definitive about the BMF loan scandal is making Malaysia a laughing stock 
for it gives the impression that the country and the government
are not seriously concerned about the scandalous affair which has
brought Malaysia’s financial situation and reputation to its lowest
point.

I also welcome Tun Hussein Onn’s call to make the Ahmad
Nordin BMF Inquiry Committee Reports and Briefs public.

The government should not continue to withold publication
of such reports to the public because it could only strengthen
public suspicion that the Government has something to hide which
has prevented a full and frank disclosure of all aspects of the
BMF Scandals.

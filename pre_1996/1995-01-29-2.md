# One reason why DAP withdraws from Gagasan Rakyat is because it had not been able to function or operate smoothly – as for example, the Malaysian Solidarity Party, one of the seven member parties, was virtually dissolved since the last general elections

DAP will face the next general elections completely on its own, now that if has withdrawn from the Gagasan Rakyat.</u>

Apart from dispelling the MCA and Gerakan lies that the DAP had co-operated with PAS and supported PAS’ hukum hunud and Islamisation policies, another reason for the DAP’s withdrawal from Gagasan Rakyat is that Gagasan Rakyat had not been able to function or operate smoothly since the 1990 general elections.

In fact, immediately after the last general elections, one of the seven members of Gagasan Rakyat, Malaysian Solidarity Party, which had only a handful of members, was virtually dissolved with the resignation of its Chairman, Yeoh Poh San and other Central Committee members.

This was why the Malaysian Solidarity Party was never represented in any Gagasan Rakyat meeting after the last general elections.

However, I am sure this will not prevent the MCA and Gerakan propaganda mills from trying to ‘squeeze blood from stone’ and to stage, for instance, a fake scenario of hundreds or even thousands of people claiming suddenly to be Malaysian Solidarity Party members and leaders all realizing the ‘futility’ of the Opposition and Gagasan Rakyat, and applying to join the MCA or Gerakan.

After all, if the MCA leaders could stage ‘public dramas’ of hundreds of DAP ‘supporters’ and a handful of former DAP members ‘leaving the DAP’, which are given big newspaper treatment by newspapers who do not pause to consider how DAP ‘supporters’ and former DAP members could ‘leave’ the DAP, it should not be difficult for the MCA and Gerakan propaganda mills to stage another ‘public drama’ of the defunct Malaysian Solidarity Party leaving the Gagasan Rakyat for Barisan Nasional either through the MCA or Gerakan.

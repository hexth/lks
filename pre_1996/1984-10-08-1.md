# DAP to expose Tan Koon Swan MCA faction’s motives in supporting the Malacca Chief Minister’s Bukit China plan

Last week, I asked Tan Koon Swan to accept full responsibility for the actions and statements of leaders of his MCA faction, including the series of vicious and malicious articles in the Tan Koon Swan – controlled Berita Awam calculated to character – assassinate me over the Bukit China issue, and to apologise for the Berita Awam’s three – month long campaign of vilification against me.</u>

As there has been no response whatsoever from Tan Koon Swan, I take it that he is not prepared to disown the actions of his faction and Berita Awam and to apologise for them.

As I said last week, Tan Koon Swan would have to face the consequences, and the DAP will exposing Tan Koon Swan MCA faction’s motives in supporting the Malacca Chief Minister’s plan to level and develop Bukit China.

Lim Kit Siang to seek meeting with Bank Negara Governor over the $30 million loan irregularities of a local finance company

I have decided to seek an appointment with the Governor of Bank Negara over the $30 million loan irregularities of a local finance company. This local finance company lent out about $20 million to two companies whose paid – up capital is only $2.

With the Bumiputra Malaysia Finance loans scandal in Hong Kong, which shattered Malaysia’s banking and financial standing internationally, Malaysia cannot afford any more local financial scandals.

Section 20(1) of the Finance Companies Act 1969 provides that “A licensed finance company shall not grant to any person an unsecured advance, loan or credit facility which in the aggregate at any one time exceeds five thousand ringgit.” Any breach is a criminal offence liable to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or a three years’ jail or both.

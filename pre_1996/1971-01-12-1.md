# Unconditional release appeal for Inche Dzulkifli Ismail

Last Saturday, 9th January 1971, I sent the following letter to the Minister of Home Affairs, Tun Dr.Ismail bin Dato Abdul Rahman, urging the unconditional release of State Assemblyman for Ulu Kuantan, Pahang, Inche Dzulkifli Ismail:

“Yang Berhormat

Tun (Dr.) Ismail bin Dato Abdul Rahman

Menteri Hal Ehwal Dalam Negeri,

Malaysia,

Kuala Lumpur.

Sir,

# Appeal for unconditional release of Inche Dzulkifli Ismail

I wish to join the appeal made by Che Norlia Hassan, wife of Inche Dzulkifli Ismail, State Assemblyman for Ulu Kuantan, Pahang, on 1st January 1971 for her husband’s unconditional release from detention in Batu Gajah under the Internal Security Act.</u>

Inche Dzulkifli Ismail was detained at the same time as Inche S.Sivasubramaniam, State Assemblyman for Tanah Puteh, Pahang, and on the same grounds.

Inche S.Sivasubramaniam has been released without conditions on 1st October 1970. Inche Dzulkifli’s continued detention, therefore, cannot but appear to be a gross injustice.

Inche Dzulkifli has already exceeded Inche S.Sivasubramaniam’s detention by more than three months, although both detained on the same grounds. I therefore appeal to you to exercise your powers to release Inche Dzulkifli unconditionally, so tat he can return to his constituency to discharge his constituency obligations to his electorate.

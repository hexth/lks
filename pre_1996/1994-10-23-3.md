# Special Oral Question in Parliament tomorrow on Rahim Tamby Cik under Standing Order 22(l) on a matter of urgent public importance without notice

The special oral question which I will table in tomorrow on the case of Tan Sri Rahim Tamby Cik under Standing Order 22(1) cm a matter of urgent public importance without notice is as follows:</u>

"To ask the Prime Minister to state:

(i) the reasons for the decision by the Attorney-General, Datuk Mohtar Abdullah to direct the Police to close investigations into the allegation that Tan Sri Rahim Tamby Cik had committed the offence of statutory rape with an underaged schoolgirl;

(ii) why the Attorney General had breached the maxim that 'Justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done' in his press conference statements last Friday where he was overprotective of Rahim Tamby Cik while being very unfair to the underaged schoolgirl;

(iii) whether the Government now admits that it was most unfair to the girl on the part of the Attorney-General to reveal police reports alleging that 14 other men had sexual relations with her and. her pregnancy, as both matters had nothing to do with the allegation as to whether Rahim Tamby Cik had committed the offence of statutory rape with an underaged schoolgirl; and

(iv) why the Police 'required' the girl to lodge 17 police reports on allegations that 14 other men had sexual relations with her but did not require' the girl to lodge formal police report against Rahim Tamby Cik for the offence of statutory rape with an underaged girl;

(v)why the girl is still being kept under police custody and not allowed to be returned to her family members;

(vi)whether it is true as alleged by the Malacca Chief Minister, Datuk Mohd Zin Abdul Ghani on Saturday that "certain people with ulterior mo¬tives had conspired to topple Rahim Tamby Cik as Malacca. Chief Minister by concocting the allegation that Rahim Tamby Cik had committed the of¬fence of statutory rape with an underaged schoolgirl because they are envious of Rahim's capabilities and achievements", and if so, whether a full-scale investigation would be initiated to uncover such a plot;

(vii)who were the people who first reported to the Prime Minister of the allegation that Rahim had committed the offence of statutory rape with an underaged schoolgirl as it was the Prime Minister who was the first to publicly refer to such an allegation and which was extensively reported in the newspapers on August 26; and

(viii)whether Tan Sri Rahim Tamby Cik would be restored his positions as Malacca Chief Minister and UMNO Youth Leader or would be allowed to play other Govemment roles now that the Attorney- General had directed the closing of police investigations."

# Strongest signal of general elections anytime

		The Muar statement by the Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, yesterday is the strongest signal to date that general elections would be held this year, and could be held anytime.</u>

		I think October is the most likely month that general elections would be held, although it could be held even earlier.

		In anticipation of early general elections, the DAP has started preparations since early this year. With the strong signal from Dr. Mahathir of general elections 'any time', DAP will put our general elections machinery all over the country into top gear.

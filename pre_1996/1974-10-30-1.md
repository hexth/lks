# DAP shocked over arrest of SNAP Leader, Datuk James Wong

I am shocked to learn of the detention under the PPSO of SNAP leader, Datuk James Wong is his Kuching home this morning.

I call on the government to explain to the people of Sarawak and Malaysia the reason for the detention of Datuk James Wong.

To use arbitrary powers of arrest without trial of opposition leaders can only undermine the peopleâ€™s confidence in the democratic system and can only be seen nationally and internationally as a further step in the elimination of criticism, dissent and opposition to pave the way for a one-party states.

We in the DAP deplore the high-handed action detention of Datuk James Wong and call for his immediate release.

In this hour of trial of SNAP, we in the DAP express our full solidarity and support in the fight against growing dictatorial trends and attitudes in the country.

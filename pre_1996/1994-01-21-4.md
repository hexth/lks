# Non – Aligned Movement should form the nucleus to requisition an emergency UN General Assembly session on the Bosnia Holocaust to override and end the impotence of the United Nations Security council and UN Secretary – General

The latest round of Geneva pence talks on Bosnia  Herregovina has ended in a farce with no effect whatsoever on the Bosnia battlefield as the 21-month agony of the Bosnian Holocaust continued unabated.</u>

As if to mark the futility of the latest round of Geneva peace talks , the uNited Nations had suspended and international airlift into Sarajevo after bullets hit a second relief plane in two days.

It is outrageous and scandalous that the United Nations , the United States and Nato nations ,with all the air power under their command , could allow the Serbian on mountaineers towering over Sarajevo to hold them to random and to betray their moral and international obligations to open up the Bosnian capital in accordance with United Nations Security council resolution.

There is only one caption left to override the United Nations General Assembly for the majority of the nations in the world to direct in unequivocal terms both the United Nations Security council and the UN Secretary General to use all necessary force ti save the sovereign Bosnian nation which had been admitted into the united Nations and end atrocities in Bosnia.

The emergency UN General Assembly shoyld make it clear that if the uN security council and the UN secretary – general fail to implement its mandate , then the UN security council should be reconstituted and the Un secretary – General replaced.

Lord Owen , one of the mediators In the Bosnia conflict , said two days ago that western patience was wearing them on Bosnian and that government would soon have to decide whether their humanitarian effort on the ground was contributing to peace of prolonging the war.

The international community must make clear that its patience in wearing thin on the Western nations who through their double standards and immoral cowardicc have failed to rise up to their moral and international responsibility to end the Bosnian Holocaust – which is an indictment on International morality , and in particular on the United Nations , the united States and Nato nations.

This is why an international initiative must be lauched to requisition the convening of an emergency united Nations General assembly in the Bosnian Holocaust.

The Non – aligned Movement should form the nucleus to requisition such an emergency UN Generak Assembly on Bosnia Herzegovina , for they have the sufficient numbers to requisition for such a emergency UN General Assembly in the Shortest possible time.

The Malaysian Government should seriously consider ways and means whereby the Non – Aligned movement could form the nucleus for such an international initiative to end the Bosnian holocaust.

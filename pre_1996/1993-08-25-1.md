# Announcement by MCA Director-General that no crime had been committed in the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal ‘most shocking and unbelievable’

The announcement by the Director-General of Anti-Corruption Agency, Tan Sri Zulkifli Mahmood, that the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal is closed and that no crime had been committed is most shocking and unbelievable.</u>

I will make a fuller statement tomorrow after I have studied the statement by the ACA Director-General.

I can only say that today will go down as a sad day for Malaysians who had hoped that Malaysia will join in the Asian-wide clean up of corruption, money politics, abuses of power and all forms of unethical practices.

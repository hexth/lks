# The DAP welcomes the new regulations requiring government officers to declare all the interests held by them and their families.

This ruling, however, must be extended to all officers who are paid from the taxpayersâ€™ pockets, including Ministers, Mentri2 Besar, State Executive Councillors, Parlimentary and Political Secretaries, Members of Parliament and Members of Statutory Boards.
Many politicians have used their public officers as stepping stones to amass personal wealth and fortunes.</u>

Corruption can only be seriously tackled if Ministers, Menteri Besars, State Executive Councillors, Parliamentary and Political Secretaries set the example to show that they are prepared to have their assets scrutinized by the public, to ensure that they had been no ill-gotten gains during their term of office.

Despite repeated calls by the DAP, the government has refused to require Ministers and other public officials to publicly declare their assets from time to time. So long as this is not done, so long will corruption remain rampant in Malaysia. It is not use catching the ikan bilis when the big fishes, the ikan yu, are left alone.

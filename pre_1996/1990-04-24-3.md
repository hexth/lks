# The Tunku is reported to have criticised the Government for giving the Malays monopoly over the country’s trade and commerce, suggesting that the right thing to do was for the government to let the Chinese handle trade and commerce and tax them when they made profit.

It is only fair that the Tunku should first be given a chance to clarify and respond to the orchestrated attacks that are being made on him by the UMNO leaders.</u>

As far as the DAP is concerned, we believe that monopoly in any sector of the economy and in any field of national life by any community is undesirable and unhealthy for Malaysian nation-building.

The DAP would like to see the Malays, and in fact, the Kadazans and Ibans, to play their full role and take their rightful place in the commerce and industry of the nation. I do not think this is ever a question in dispute. But what is clearly deserving of serious government attention is that the Chinese and Indians, for instance, feel that they are conscribed and impeded, and even shut out in certain areas, from playing their rightful role as Malaysian citizens in commerce and industry.

If Malaysia is to be stable, strong and ready to face the challenges of the 90s and the 21st century, then the government must recognise its mistakes and failures in nation-building policies, and seek to restore public confidence by all Malaysians, regardless of race.

# DAP calls on Tsu Koon to direct the restoration of Penang Hill railway concessionary fare to Penang Hill residents

Penang DAP calls on the Penang Chief Minister, Dr. Koh Tsu Koon, to direct the restoration of Penang Hill railway concessionary fare to Penang Hill residents.</u>

It is clearly very burdensome for the Penang Hill residents to pay RM3 for a single trip instead of the concessionary 75 sen.

The Penang Hill residents have suffered for more thn seven months since the withdrawal of the Penang Hill railway concessionary fare on Jnuary 1 this year, and Tsu Koon should stop turning a deaf ear to their repeated appeals for the restoration of the concessionary fare.

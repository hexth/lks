# DAP MPs will demand and challenge the Attorney General’s decision to prosecute Parm Cumarasamy for Sedition in the Budget meeting of Parliament

The DAP is gravely concerned by the arrest and prosecution of Param Cumarasamy on sedition charge. DAP MPs will question and challenge the Attorney General’s decision to prosecute Param Cumarasamy for sedition in next month’s Parliamentary meeting and ask why no one was prosecuted for sedition during the 1983 Constitutional Crisis when there were many attacks on the Rulers.</u>

Under the Section 5 of the Sedition Act, no person shall be prosecuted for an offence of sedition without the written consent of the Public Prosecutor, in this case the Attorney General.

Althought, it would be improper to discuss whether Param had committed sedition as this will be sub judice as this would be for the courts to decide, Parliament and even the people have the right to question the Attorney General’s decision to give consent for the prosecution of Param. The Attorney General’s decision to give consent to prosecution cannot be questioned in the courts hit it could be questioned in Parliament and before the bar of public opinion.

DAP MPs will demand that the Attorney General spell out the criteria which serve as his guide to decide whether to consent to prosecution on sedition charges or to withold consent and if the Attorney General is unable to give a satisfactory explanation as to how and on what basis he decides on giving or witholding consent on prosecution of sedition, the DAP MPs would seriously consider moving a motion of censure against the Attorney General in Parliament.

Malaysia has been put in the dock of international opinion for this ease can only highlight the deplorable state of human rights in Malaysia.

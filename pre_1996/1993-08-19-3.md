# Selangor Mentri Besar setting a bad example in interfering and stopping the construction of a cathedral in Shah Alam

The Selangor Mentri Besar, Tan Sri Muhammad Haji Muhammad Taib, is setting a bad example in interfering and stopping the construction of a cathedral in Shah Alam.</u>

Yesterday, Tan Sri Muhammad said that he had instructed the Shah Alam Municipal Council to withdrawn its earlier approval for the construction of a multi-million ringgit project.

As Malaysia is a multi-religious society, the building of religious places of worship by one religion should not be regarded as a threat to another religion.

All religious must maintain an open mind and attitude and regard the building of religious places of worship, even if they are the biggest in Asia for that religion, as a distinction and something which Malaysians of all religious can feel proud for the nation.

Tan Sri Muhamad should reconsider his action and refrain from intefering with the approval granted by the Shah Alam Municipal Council for the cathedral.

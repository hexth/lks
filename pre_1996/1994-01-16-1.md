# DAP central working committee empowers Sabah DAP to make final decision with regard to Sabah state general elections 

The DAP central working committee empowers Sabah DAP to make final decision with regard to Sabah state general elections to be held on February 18 and 19.</u>

At its meeting in Petaling Jaya , last night , the DAP CWC heard a report form the sabah DAP State Chairman , Sdr. Gung Ket Wing , on the Sabah political situation – such as the factors leading  to January 10 dissolution of the Sabah State Assembly ; the moves for PBS ‘s return to Barisan Nasional , the terms for such a return and the possibility of such a retrn taking place before Nomination Day on February 7 in which event there would be an allocation of seats between the PBS and the Sabah Barisan Nasional component parties , preparation for a new PBS leadership line-up in the event of an adverse outcome in the corruption trial of Datuk Joseph Pairin Kitigan like the fielding od Dr. Jeffrey Kikingan and Dr. Maximus ongkili as candidates in the general elections.

Sabah DAP can play a most unique and important role in Sabah Politics and the Sabah State Assembly to uphold the best lon term interest of the people of sabah especially in view of rapid behind the scene political developments taking place in Sabah , but the people of Sabah must decide whether they want Sabah DAP to play this role.

Sabah DAP has three options:

	To stay out of the general elections by not fielding a single candidate;

	To contest in as big a way and fiels as many candidate as possible ; or 

A nominal participation to anchieve the first DAP breakthrough in the Sabah State Assembly

Sabah DAP will get further feedbacks from the people of Sabah before making its final decision as to Sabah DAP’s posture for next month’s Sabah state general elections.

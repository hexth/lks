# Has the Election Commission been instructed by UMNO to conduct another snap voters registration exercise as happened just before the 1990 general elections?

The statement by the UMNO Vice President, Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak, that UMNO Supreme Council has directed all UMNO State Liaison Committees to register UMNO members as voters has raised the question whether the Election Commission has been instructed to conduct another snap voters' registration exercise this year as happened just before the 1990 general elections.</u>

Najib said that of the 1.9 million UMNO members, some 388,000 who are eligible to vote have yet to register as voters, and that UMNO wants UMNO members to make up 50 per cent of the electorate in every Parliamentary constituency in Peninsular Malaysia.

The independence and integrity of the Election Commission have again been undermined by the statement by Najib, and the Election Commission should explain whether it is the Election Commission for UMNO, or Election Commission for the whole nation!

# DAP calls on Tun Razak to intervene and settle the interpreter’s claims to allow them to get a just deal

The DAP calls on the Prime minister, Tun Razak, to intervene in the court interpreters’ strike and accede to the interpreters’ claim for  pay scale revisions, which had not been adjusted for 23 years, to prove that all workers can get a just and fair deal in Malaysia.

The DAP supports all efforts by workers to fight for a better deal. It is useless to have increasing GNP or to have one of the highest living standards in Asia, if our workers are lowly paid. This great contrast can only mean that the fruits of economic development have not been distributed equally and fairly among all sections of Malaysians, but are being monpolised by the Malaysian rich.

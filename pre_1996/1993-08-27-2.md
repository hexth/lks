# Three more challenges to Liong Sik to make a total of ten challenges for the MCA President to accept within a week

I have until yesterday issued seven challenges to the MCA President, Datuk Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik, for him to accept within a week.</u>

The first challenge was issued on Tuesday, which challenged Liong Sik to declare his family asserts within a week. I want to remind Liong Sik that he has only got four days left to accept this challenge.

I issued another four challenges to Liong Sik on Wednesday, namely:

Second challenge: To make the direct allegation that I am corrupt instead of hiding behind the term politically corrupt so that I am could file a second defamation suit against him;

Third challenge: To answer whether he got his inspiration for challenging me to lodge a report that he is corrupt and his declaration that if he is found to be corrupt he would retire from politics firstly, from the example of MIC President, Datuk Seri S Samy Vellu in the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal and Malacca Chief Minister, Tan Sri Rahim Tamby Cik in his unusual wealth scandal and secondly, because at present there are Ministers, deputy MiNISTERS, Mentri-mentri Besar and Chief Ministers who have been found to be corrupt but who could continue to hold political office;

Fourth Challenge: To file defamation proceedings against me if he believes that I have charged him with being corrupt and

Fifth Challenge: To get Lee Kim Sai Sai, Ng Cheng Kiat and Kok Wee Kiat to publicly declare that they were satisfied with his explanation about his Bolton Finance scandal.

I want to remind Liong Sik that he got have only five days left to accept these four challenges.

Yesterday, I issued two more challenges to Liong Sik. They were:

Sixth Challenge: For Liong Sik and my lawyers to sign an agreement to pay compensation of RM500,000 for educational or charitable purposes to be named by me if he and his lawyers delay the full hearing of my defamation suit againt him from being held withi three months or the earliest possible date, with a similar undertaking on my part; and

Seventh Challenge: To accept a Lim Kit Siang Ling Liong Sik mutual; questioning session at a time and place of his choice where he could ask any questions on the DAP Save Bukit China Fund ND WHERE HE WOULD HAVE TO ANSWER My question on the numerous MCA financial scandals, including his Bolton Finance scandal.


Challenge to Liong Sik to take a solemn public oath within a week to deny that ten years ago he had collocated with Tan Sri Rahimthamby Cikin his conspiracy to demolish Bukit China

Today, I have issuing Liong Sikm with three more challenges, making a total ten challenges for the MCA Presidnet to accept within a week. These three new challenges are:

Eightth Challenge: I challenge Liong Sik to deny with a solemn public oath that ten years ago, he had collocated woth Malcca Chief Minister, Tan Sri Rahim Tamby Cik , in the latter’s conspiracy to demolish Bukit China and if not for DAP ‘s Save Bukit China campaign, Liong Sik would have aided and abetted Rahim Tamby Cik in destroying the most ancient Chinese cementry hill in Malaysia which stands as historic proof of the earliest Sino-Malay co-operation as well as Chinese contribution in Malaysia;

Ninth Challenge: To give full, satisfactory and acceptable explanation for five MCA financial scandals. Namely:
(i)	The Multi Purpose Holdings sale scandals;
(ii)	The KSM Rescue Scandal
(iii)	The Chang Min Thian Education Fund Scandal
(iv)	The MCA Save Bukit China Fund Scandal
(v)	Liong Sik own Bolton Finance scandal and

Tenth Challenge: To name his cowdrug counselors who had given him three disastrous political gabits against the DAP in the past two months, namely:
(i)	to challenge me to announce the DAP Save Bukit China One Person One Dollar Fund within a weel, not realishing that I would accept the challenge without hesitation
(ii)	Tsu Tong Poh’s cow drug political theory, which ended up with liong Sik himself splattered all over his face with cow dung and
(iii)	The present challenge to me to make a police report that Liong Sik is corrupt not reslishing that it only exposed the MCA President as a person without reputation, honour or integrity to defend when he dare not file legal action when he believed that he had been accused of being corrupt

It is no wonder that for Liong Sik third political gambit against me in two months, the MCA President needs the public backing of all the MCA national leaders, MCA Youth and Wanita leaders, and even braches had to be mobilized to give him support.

I can and am prepared to take on Liong Sik and all the MCA national leaders, MCA Youth Leaders and MCA Wanita leaders and even their branches single-handedly, for Liong Sik’s cow dung political counselor make the fatal mistake of believing that a thousand repatition of a lie can turn it into a truth!

If MCA leadership can only furnish more detailed materials from previous press clippings after some ten police reports against the DAP Save Bukit China Fund in the past eight years, either MCA leaders are utterly incompetent or they are only out to get cheap publicly

This also why Liong Sik’s cow dung counselors have to stage-manage the clownish charade of five MCA leaders going to the Bukit Aman police yesterday allegedly to furnish more detailed materials in connection with MCA police reports against the DAP Save Bukit China FUND.

In the last eight years, the MCA throughout the country must have lodged around ten police reports against the DAP Save Bukit China Fund. If the MCA leadership has to wait for eight years bedore they could furnish more detailed materials from past press clippings, either the MCA leadership are evn more imcompenent that generally known, or they are only out to get cheap publicly.

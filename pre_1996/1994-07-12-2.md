# Malaysian Government should impress on visiting Myanmese Foreign Minister, U Ohn Gyaw, on the need for Myanmar military junta to restore democracy and human rights, including the immediate release of Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Aung San Su Kyi

The Malaysian Government should impress on the visiting Myanmese Foreign Minister, U Ohn Gyaw, on the need for Myanmar military junta to restore democracy and human rights, including the immediate release of Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Aung San Su Kyi</u>

U Oh Gyaw’s three-day visit to Malysia at the invitation of the Foreign Minister, Datuk Abdullah Badawi, and his lecture at the Institute of Diplomacy and Foreign Relations (IDFR) Malaysia yesterday, might be construed as a change of Malaysian foreign policy in giving support to the undemocratic and repressive policies of the Myanmese military junta – in particular in the prolonged detention of Aung San Su Kyi.

The policy of ‘constructive engagement’ by Malaysia and ASEAN countries vis-à-vis Myanmar has not produce any democratization in Myanmar, and U Oh Gyaw should be told in no uncertain terms that unless the SLOPC military junta in Myanmar shows greater respect for democracy and human rights in its country, the Myamese military junta is not welcome to the ASEAN Ministerial Conference in Bangkok later this month.

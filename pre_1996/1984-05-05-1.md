# Dap calls for the establishment of a Parliamentary select Committee to investigate in Mak Foon Than’s allegations that he had acted as agent for Finance Minister, Tengku Razaleigh and other Cabinet Minister in Hong Kong

The Finance Minister, Tengku Razaleigh, has strongly denied  in tato the allegations made by the allegations made by the accused killer Mak Foon Than, that Mak was his agent and had been sent to hong kong to collect $6 million from businessmen during the time of the murder of Bumiputra Malaysia Finance assistant general manager, Jalil Ibrahim in July 1983.</u>

I welcome the Finance Minister’s straightforward denial, but I am sure he would agree that the serious allegation made by Mak Foon Than, now arraigned for the murder of Jalil Ibrahim in the Hong Kong High Court, that he was agent for Tengku Razaleigh, whom he claimed to have worked for eight years, as well as for other Malaysian Cabinet Ministers, would not be laid to rest by a mere denial.

The Best and most effective way for the Finance Minister to clear his name as well as that of other Cabinet Minister implicated in Mak Foon Than’s allegation is for the establishment of a Parliamentary Select Committee to investigate into Mak’s allegation, and for every Cabinet Minister to submit to searching inquiries about their association with Mak or with Hong Kong businesses or businessmen.

In fact, the Finance Minister should himself ask the Cabinet to agree to the establishment of such a Parliamentary Select Committee to investigate into Mak’s allegations, which are very serious for they go the root of the integrity and honesty of the Malaysian Cabinet, as this would give him an opportunity to clear himself and his name.

Tengku Razaleigh’s statement in Kota Bharu yesterday that to prove his innocence, he was prepared to have his service record inspected, to establish that he had nothing to do with either the BMF or the Carrian affair, is one step in the right direction.

Tengku Razaleigh’s charge that there were ‘forces’ to destroy him politically, mentioning the previous case of the UMBC affair prior to the 1981 UMNO General Assembly, and that the entire Malaysian Cabinet may be the target of such ‘forces’ should also be made the subject of inquiry by the Parliamentary Select Committee.

Tengku Razaleigh’s allegation that the bringing forward of the Mak trial from September to close to the UMNO General Assembly in May was to ‘discredit him’ and indicated that ‘invisible power’ being wielded in the country, deserves the fullest investigation to establish their authenticity.

If there are mysterious invisible forces which are so powerful as to be able to undermine the Finance Minister and even the entire Cabinet, then this must be fully exposed for otherwise, Malaysia will never have political will and independence of its own.

The DAP therefore calls for the summoning of an Emergency meeting of Parliament to establish Parliamentary Select Committee to investigate into Mak Foon Than’s allegations about his relationship with the Finance Minister and other Ministers, as well as the Finance 
Minister’s allegations about the invisible mysterious forces undermining Malaysia political independence and will.

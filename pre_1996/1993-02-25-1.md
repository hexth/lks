# Urgent fax to Inspector-General of Police to ensure that no MP is threatened with harm, including death, to himself and his family for discharging his duties as a people’s representative

DAP takes a very serious view of the criminal intimidation of the DAP MP for Bukit Bintang, Sdr. Wee Choo Keong, threatening his and his family with harm, including death, in the course of discharging his duties as a people’s representative.</u>

I have today sent an urgent fax to the Inspector-General of Police, Tan Sri Haniff Omar, to give his personal attention to this grave development ad to take all necessary actions to ensure that elected representatives of the people and their family members are not intimidated or harmed in the course of discharging their duties.

DAP is following closely criminal attempts to intimidate and coerce the DAP MP for Bukit Bintang, and if anything untoward should happen to Wee Choo Keong, his family or others, we will hold those behind the criminal intimidation and threats fully responsible.

# Gim Hwa should not make wild and baseless political attacks to camouflage his undemocratic refusal to abide by the principles of accountability and transparency with regard to MPPP decision like Taman Midlands project

I would advise the MPP presient . Datuk Tan Gim Hwa not to make wild and baseless political attacks to camouflage his undemocratic refusal to abide by the principles of accountability and transparency with regard to MPPP decision like Taman Midlands project.</u>

At the Swearing in of this year ‘s MPPP councilors on Thursday , Gim Hwa attacked the DAP of ‘ dirty trctics’ underhand tactics and scare tactics In opposing development in the Taman Midlands case.

It is Gim Hwa who is guilty of ‘unscrupulous tactics’ and it is most regrettable that instead of addressing the core grievances of the residents who would be affected by the Taman Midlands ‘ one stop centre ‘ project , Gim Hwa had resorted to the politics of abuse against the DAP . He should know that only those who have conceded defeat in a public argument resort to abuses.

Is this because Gim Hwa cannot give one simple reason why the had denied the democratic rights of the affected residents to know what are the details of the planning applications submitted by Pangkal Permata( M) sdn , Bhd for the Taman Midlands “one Stop Centre ‘ by putting such planning application on public display so that the affected residents could informatively and knowledgeably give their views?

Is Tam Gim Hwa prepared to give a public undertaking that the MPPP would not give any planning approvals until the affected residents had been given the opportunity to study the planning applications and to give their views?

Is this also because Gim Hwa cannot answer the issues which had been raised by the DAP on the Midlands project , especially with regard to question as to whether the State Government had legally given consent to the MPPP to give the 99 year lease to Pangkal Permata (M) Sdn . Bhd as required by the Local Government Act 1976 – when the terms and conditions of the lease were never presented to the State Exectutive council for approval in the first place?

And what has happened to three – man inquiry committee set up by the Chief Minister , Dr,Koh Tsu Koon , into the Taman Midlands Scandal – the Tan Gim Hwa Committee to investigate Tan Gim Hwa?


Calls on Tan Gim Hwa to declare his stand – whether he supports Pangkal Permata (M) Sdn . Bhd or the Housing Developers’ Association Malaysia (Penang Branch) on collection of booking fees without sale and advertisement permit , developer’s licence and planning approval

What is the outcome of its investigation  into the illegal sale if commercial and residental units at Taman Midlands ‘ one stop centre’ and to illegal collection of booking fees?

Yesterday , the Housing Developers’  Assciation of Malaysia(Penang Branch  took out an advertisement by Pangkal Permata (M) sdn Bhd on January 3, 1994.

	The advertisement asid :

Our members have all along been advised that the provisions of the housing Developers(Control and Licensing ) Act 1966 defining

Housing accommodation to include any building …constructed , adapted or intended for human habitation or party for human habitatipn and partly for business premises; and

Housing development to include to develop or construct … iore than four units of housing accommodation are clear and unambiguous , and apply to mixed developments having both a commercial as well as housing content , the latter exceeding four units.

We have therefore always advised our members against collecting any monies until they have complied with all Government requirements including planning and licensing approvals .”

Let Tan Gim  Hwa as MPPP President declare his stand on this issue, whether he supports Pnagkal Permata (M) sdn .Bhd or the housing Developers’ Association Malaysia (Penang Branch ) on the question of collection of booking fees without sale and advertising permit , developers’ licence and planning approval?

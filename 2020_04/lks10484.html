					<h1>The latest data on Covid-19 pandemic is a case for lifting of MOC although with conditions to deal with  any resurgence of the virus infection</h1>
		
			<p>The latest data on Covid-19 pandemic is a case for lifting of  the  movement control order (MCO) although with conditions to deal with  any resurgence of the virus infection.

<p>Health Director-General, Datuk Seri Dr. Noor Hisham Abdullah  yesterday announced that the total number of Covid-19 cases in Malaysia had reached 4,119 with an increase of 156 new cases.

<p>There were  two new deaths, bringing the death toll to 65.

<p>The number of recoveries has for the second time exceeded the number of new cases – with a daily increase of 166 people.  bringing the total recoveries to 1,487 cases or 36.1 percent of total infections.

<p>For those under treatment, 76 people are in the intensive care unit, down from 92 the previous day.

<p>Of those in ICU, 45 are on ventilators, down from 50 the previous day.

<p>But Noor Hisham made quite a cryptic remark when he said: “Although we have not won the war yet, neither have we lost the war.”

<p>No country can win the war against the Covid-19 virus, until an effective vaccine against it is developed in 12 – 18 months’ time or longer.

<p>Meanwhile, until an effective vaccine is available, the twin challenges for  every country  is to win the war  against Covid-19 in  every wave of resurgence with the minimum loss of lives and to win the war in pandemic economics with the minimum of  devastation to the economy.

<p>The current surge of Covid-19 cases, which caused the imposition of the movement control order (MCO) on March 18, was to address the worst-case scenario of the second wave of Covid-19 outbreak peaking  in mid-April with 6,300 cases (forecast of JP Morgan) or  the even grimmer  forecast of the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research (MIER) of a higher peak figure of 8,900 cases.

<p>From  the data on the Covid-19 cases, it would appear that  the peak of the second wave of Covid-19 outbreak in Malaysia was reached on April 3 with 3,333 cases (with the  daily increase of 217 cases), and since then, the infection growth rate  had slowed to a daily increase from  150 to 179 cases a day.

<p>The data for the Covid-19 cases since the MCO is as follows:

<p>With  the daily infection falling  below the 200 figure in the last five days, the  MCO imposed on 18th March and extended from April 1 to 14 had been successful in both curbing the spread and mortality of Covid-19.

<p>If this epidemiological  curve is sustained, the case for the lifting of the MCO though with conditions to deal with any resurgence of the novel coronavirus, will be irresistible.

<p>There  is no proper answer as to what is the best exit strategy for a full or partial lockdown as  different countries impose varying  variations for their Covid-19  lockdowns.

<p> But one thing is certain. Until  an effective vaccine against Covid-19 is developed in 12 to 18 months’ time or longer, life can never be the same again, and a new norm must be observed which includes social distancing as a long-term life style, cleaning hands and surfaces as a new norm, no big public gatherings, screening of all travellers into the country, ramping up of mass testing capability, use of technology to trace contacts, etc.;

<p>Malaysia must develop its own exit strategy, which must meet the purpose of  ensuring that the Covid 19 virus, though not eliminated until the development of an vaccine, is sufficiently contained to allow the economic engine to restart and for  lives to return to as much normalcy as possible.

<p>If the division of the country  into four coloured zones  for Covid-19 infections is used as a basis for an exit strategy for controlled easing of restriction of movement, the National Security Council and the Ministry  of Health should issue a daily release of the current status of each district, and not just the cumulative figures for infections in each district as is the present practice.

<p>So far, 23 districts have been declared as red zones or  Covid-19 hotspots with at least 41 cases, but these are based on  outdated data as they use  cumulative Covid-19 figures without taking into consideration recovered cases. If recovered cases are taken into account we should have far fewer  red zones in the country.

<p>Malaysia has achieved a high rate of recoveries which is better than most European countries, as  out of a total 4,119 Covid-19 confirmed cases  in Malaysia since January 25, there had been  1,487 recoveries, achieving a recovery rate of 36.1%.

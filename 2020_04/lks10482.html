					<h1>The division of the country into four coloured zones  for Covid-19 infections can be used as a basis for an exit strategy for controlled easing of restrictions, but the four-colour zones  should be updated daily so as not to overstate the seriousness of Covid-19 infection  in the various parts of  the country</h1>
		
			<p>Today is a special day in the devastating Covid-19 pandemic, which has spread like a raging fire worldwide, with confirmed infections totalling  1.4 million cases  and has  claimed the lives of some 81,695 people.

<p>Covid-19 started in Wuhan, China in early December and it was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation on March 11, 2020.

<p>It has affected 209 countries and territories, and in the last three months, has reached   one grim milestone after another in the invisible global war against humanity

<p>For example, it  took 67 days from the first reported case to reach 100,000 cases, 11 days for second 100,000 cases, four days for the third 100,000 cases, three days for the fourth 100,000 cases, two days for the fifth 100,000 cases, one day for the sixth 100,000, two days for the seventh 100,000, a day each for the eighth and ninth (million) 100,000 cases. It takes two  day to reach the tenth 100,000 cases, one day each  to reach the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth 100,000 cases.  Total global confirmed cases now stand at 1,421,665!

<p>Although the Covid-19 pandemic  started in Asia, North America will overtake Europe in the number of cases in a matter days  Both  regions have exceeded 400,000 cases each, while Asia has  chalked less than 125,000 cases, with China totalling 81,7490 cases.

<p>The  Covid-19 pandemic seems to be  stabilising in the three  European countries  of  Italy, Spain, France  which had  experienced  nightmares with daily Covid-19 cases increasing from more than a thousand cases   to over  nine thousand cases  and daily Covid-19 deaths increasing from   three to  four-digit figures. The  full  ravages of Covid-19 have moved on to the United Kingdom, (whose Prime Minister Boris Johnson is in  ICU over  Covid-19) and the United States, whose President is talking about 100,000 to 200,000 deaths from the pandemic,  although two weeks ago he  was talking about America getting back to business and returning to normal  by Easter on April 12.

<p>Latest data for  the  top 12 countries with most number of Covid-19 cases (which also contain the 12 top countries for Covid-19 deaths) and Malaysia is as follows:

<ul>
	<li>United States          393,798  cases;  12,697  deaths (3.2%)</li>

	<li>Spain                      140,618 cases;    13,912 deaths (9.89%)</li>

	<li>Italy                        135,586 cases;   17,127 deaths (12.6% )   </li>

	<li>France                    109,069 cases    10,328 deaths (9.47%) </li>

	<li>Germany                107,591 cases;     2,012 deaths (1.87%)</li>

	<li>China                        81,740 cases;      3,331 deaths (4.07%)</li>

	<li>Iran                           62,589 cases;      3,872 deaths (6.2%)</li>

	<li>UK                            55,242 cases;      6,159  deaths (12.15%)</li>

	<li>Turkey                      34,109 cases;          725 deaths (2.1%)</li>

	<li>Switzerland               22,253 cases;          821 deaths (3.7%)</li>

	<li>Belgium                   22,194  cases;       2,035 deaths (9.2%)</li>

	<li>Netherlands             19,580  cases;        2,101 deaths (10.7%)</li>

	<li>Malaysia                      3,963 cases;             63 deaths (1.59%)      </li>
 </ul>

<p>Today’s opening of Wuhan is a testimony of mankind’s grit, determination and solidarity to win the invisible global war against the novel coronavirus.

<p>It is a lesson not only for  Malaysians but to the world that the invisible global war against  the novel coronavirus can be won.

<p>The latest data on the Covid-19 in Malaysia gives encouragement to my cautious optimism that we have passed the  peak of the second wave of the Covid-19 outbreak although we must be prepared for a resurgence of the  virus until a vaccine in 12 – 18 months’ time or more.

<p>This is the time that an exit strategy from the partial lockdown resulting from  the  movement control order (MCO) should be considered and discussed by all quarters, as the Covid- 19 pandemic is not just a health crisis but also an economic crisis with the lockdown shutting down  the economic engine to give priority to save lives in the war against  the virus.

<p>This is also why an emergency meeting of Parliament, even a “virtual” one, is so urgent, imperative  and should deserve first order of priority.

<p>What is the proper exit strategy?

<p>There is no proper answer as mankind all over the world is grappling with the problem for the first time.

<p>Different countries have different variations for Covid-19  lockdowns, and there can be no one answer for the various shades of lockdowns in the different countries.

<p>Malaysia must develop its own exit strategy, which must meet the purpose of  ensuring that the Covid 19 virus, though not eliminated until the development of an vaccine, is sufficiently contained to allow the economic engine to restart and for  lives to return to as much normalcy as possible.

<p>The division of the country  by the National  Security Council and the Ministry of Health into four coloured zones  for Covid-19 infections can be used as a basis for an exit strategy for controlled easing of restriction of movement, but the four-coloured zones should be updated daily so as not to overstate the seriousness of Covid-19 infection  in various parts of  the country

<p>The red zone refers to areas with more than 40 positive cases; the orange zone  for areas with 21 to 40 positive cases; the yellow zone for  areas with one to 20 positive cases and the green zone is without any positive case.

<p>The latest  infographics on the division  in the country  into the four coloured zones shows  Penang as having five districts - two in orange zone and three in yellow zone.

<p>If  recent  Covid-19 developments had been taken into account, for instance the recoveries from the Covid-19 infection  and discharge  from  hospitals, all the five districts in Penang would be in the yellow zone – in fact, the Seberang Perai Selatan district will be close to become a green zone with only one case of Covid-19 infection.

<p>In the post-MCO pandemic economics, Malaysia must develop an exit strategy which can strike the proper balance on the one hand,  to contain but not to eradicate the Covid-19 virus  until a vaccine is developed in 12 – 18 months or longer and  on the other,  to  restart the economic engine and for Malaysian life to return to as much normalcy pre-MCO  as possible.</p>

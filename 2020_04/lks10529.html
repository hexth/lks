					<h1>Did the Health Ministry advise against the holding of Parliamentary meetings, including a virtual Parliament and Select Committee meetings  to exercise oversight and scrutiny of government measures  in the Covid-19 pandemic, and propose a one-day meeting on May 18?</h1>
		
			<p>Yesterday, the French Prime Minister, Edouard Philippe, announced that he would present a national exit strategy to the French  Parliament tomorrow, which would then debate and vote on the government’s recommendations.

<p>France’s daily death toll slowed as recorded Covid-19 fatalities in France rose by 242 on Sunday, down from 369 new deaths the previous day.

<p>In the past week alone, France recorded an increase of  14,256 Covid-19 cases and 3,139 people died of the disease – way beyond the figures recorded in Malaysia.

<p>If the country which is  presently the second country after the United States with the  highest recorded number of Covid-19 confirmed cases, i.e. 226,629 cases with 23,190 deaths, could report to Parliament and seek parliamentary approval for the French national exit strategy, why is the Malaysian Parliament  being emasculated and marginalised?                                                                                                                           

<p>The Minister for Parliamentary affairs, Takiyuddin Hassan  said that the decision on the one-day Parliament on May 18 was based on the advice of the Health Ministry as well as relevant specialists for the benefit and safety of all parties.

<p>Did  the Health Ministry advise against the holding of Parliamentary meetings, including virtual Parliament and Select Committee meetings, to exercise oversight and scrutiny of government measures  in the Covid-19 pandemic, and propose instead  a one-day meeting on May 18 just  to comply with the constitutional requirement that Parliament must meet once every six months?

<p>I hope the Health director-general, Dr. Noor Hisham Abdullah, in his daily media conference today, would be able to throw some  light on  whether the Health Ministry had advised the holding of a one-day Parliament and that it  was against Parliament holding  the government to accountability and scrutiny  for all actions related to the Covid-19 pandemic?

<p>I am quite sceptical that the idea of  a one-day meeting of Parliament on May 18 had come from the Health Ministry, as  by April 17, when the parliamentary secretary sent out the  notice to all MPs about the one-day Parliament, the Health director-general and all specialists would have suspected that  the country had passed the peak of the second wave of Covid-19 outbreak, subject to confirmation by developments in the coming days.

<p>If by March 31, I could state that ““there are hopeful signs that JP Morgan’s grim projection of Malaysia peaking at 6,300 Covid-19 cases by mid-April can be proven wrong” and on April 7, I could  hazard the prognosis that the peak of the second wave of Covid-19 outbreak in Malaysia had been reached on April 3rd with 3,333 cases, I do not believe  that the health director-general or any specialist could not see the writing  on the wall and  shared with the top government leaders the view that the Covid-19 epidemiological curve had been flattened and that Malaysia was  only the downward  descent of the curve – completely unlike European countries like the United Kingdom, Spain, France and Italy and the United States.

<p>From April 17 to  yesterday, Malaysia’s daily increase in Covid-19 cases broke free from three-digit figures, and were consistently in double-digit figures ranging from 36 to 88 cases.

<p>In comparison, United Kingdom’s daily increases not only remained in four-digit figures since April 17 but ranged from 4,301 to 5,850 cases.

<p>France was  also  in four-digit figures for daily increase of Covid-10 cases   since April 17, ranging from 1,101 to 3,824 cases except yesterday when it registered an increase of 612 cases.

<p>If the idea of a one-day Parliament had not emanated  from the Health Ministry or the advice of specialists, the Minister  of parliamentary affairs should eat humble pie and ask Cabinet on Wednesday to rectify the mistake  of a one-day Parliament, which has gained  notoriety for the Malaysian Parliament in the world.

<p>The government  should instead discuss with the leaders of the political parties represented in Parliament as to how Parliament can perform its critical roles of oversight and scrutiny in the Covid-19 pandemic and not be the first country in the Covid-19 pandemic to emasculate and marginalise Parliament.</p>

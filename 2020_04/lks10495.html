					<h1>The most important lesson of MCO is that Malaysians must learn to live with Covid-19 virus for the next 12 to 18 months or more until  an effective  vaccine is developed and widely available  - and social distancing is the  most important new normal in the  post-pandemic era</h1>
		
			<p>Today marks the end of the four-week movement control order (MCO) and the  beginning of the second extension of the MCO till April 28.

<p>The  most important lesson of the  MCO is that Malaysians must learn to live with Covid-19 virus for the next 12 to 18 months or more until  an effective  vaccine is developed and widely available  - and social distancing is the most important new normal in the  post-pandemic era, not only in Malaysia but in the world, whether in economics, politics or social life.

<p>Life in Malaysia or the world  cannot return to pre-Covid-19 pandemic  even after the lifting of the movement control order (MCO).

<p>We should have been spared the  second wave of the Covid-19 outbreak, as the first wave of the outbreak registered single-digit daily increases and reached a total of 22 cases from January 24 to Feb. 16.

<p>In the ten days from Feb. 16 – 26, there was no new case of Covid-19.

<p>We must learn the expensive lesson of our inattention  and negligence which  allowed the second wave of the Covid-19 outbreak to take place and  caused the imposition of the MCO on 18th March.

<p>Hopefully we have passed the peak of the second wave of the Covid-19 outbreak, as  with the imposition of the MCO, we have avoided the worst prognosis made by JP Morgan and the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research (MIER).

<p>Instead of the second wave of Covid-19 outbreak peaking about 6,300 cases in mid-April, there was no exponential surge because of the MCO  and  it peaked on April 3 with 3,333 cases.

<p>Since then , the curve has plateaued with daily increases ranging from 109 to 184  cases – and in the two weeks to April 28, we hope to see the daily increases to  further reduce to two-digit and even  single-digit figures.

<p>According to the Health Director-General Dr. Noor Hisham Abdullah a few days ago, Malaysia’s infective rate, Covid-19 R0, was 3.55 prior to the MCO (i.e.  a positive case would have an infection rate of 3.55 persons) which  has  been brought down to 1 and he expects  the R0 will be 0.9 by April 14.

<p>The Health Director-General and frontliners fighting the invisible war against the coronavirus  must be commended for  ensuring the effectiveness of the MCO in breaking the chain of Covid-19 infections, bringing Malaysia’s R0 down to  0.9 (i.e. a  positive case would only have an infection rate of less than one person). We must now bring the R0 further down below 0.9.

<p>But we must also be prepared for new waves of Covid-19 outbreak until an effective vaccine is developed in 12 – 18 month’s time or more.

<p>In the meantime, Malaysia must constantly learn from other countries in the handling of Covid-19 pandemic in particular how to  strengthen our public health infrastructure to protect our frontliners and to ramp up Covid-19 testing, tracing and treating capabilities.

<p>On the international front, there is both good and bad news.

<p>In the  United Kingdom, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been discharged from the intensive care unit (ICU) after being treated for  three days for Covid-19 but he  will not  immediately return to work as he has still to finish his recovery.

<p>In a video, Johnson paid tribute to the medical workers with the National Health Service (NHS), saying: “I owe them my life”.

<p>However, it is bleak times for the United Kingdom as total Covid-19 death toll rose above 10,000 on Easter Sunday and chalked up another 717 deaths in the past 24 hours to make UK  one of the Big Five countries with total death toll exceeding 10,000 deaths. There are now  seven countries which have surpassed China’s total death toll of 3,341, viz:

<ul>
	<li>United States           23,555 deaths (5.0%)</li>

	<li>Italy                         20,465 deaths (12.8%)</li>

	<li>Spain                       17,756 deaths (10.4%)</li>

	<li>France                     14,967 deaths (10.9%)</li>

	<li>United Kingdom      11,329 deaths (12.8%)</li>

	<li>Iran                             4,585 deaths (  6.2%)</li>

	<li>Belgium                     3,903 deaths (12.8%)</li>

	<li>China                          3,341 deaths (  4.1%)</li>
</ul>
 
<p>The prospects in United Kingdom become all the bleaker with government forecast that Britain risks having the highest death toll from the novel coronavirus in Europe in the region of 30,000 deaths.

<p>Among the 119,410  people in the world who had died with coronavirus are doctors, nurses, surgeons, care workers, healthcare assistants and  porters, including doctors and nurses  who came out of retirement to fight  the invisible war against Covid-19.

<p>There is growing criticism in UK  against the government’s  response to the pandemic from senior medics and political leaders, particularly over its failure to get enough personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing to National Health Service (NHS) and care home workers.

<p>We must learn from the tragic  lessons in UK, the United States, Italy, Spain, France and other countries to strengthen our public health infrastructure to protect our frontliners to ensure they are provided with the necessary personal protective equipment (PPE)  and to ramp up Covid-19 testing, tracing and treating capabilities to ensure that they do not become casualties in the invisible war against the coronavirus.

<p>The grim milestones on the international front  in the Covi-19 pandemic include:

<ol>
	<li>The global total of confirmed Covid-19 cases now stands at 1,851,573 with 114,175 deaths. It took 91 days  from the first reported case to reach the first  million mark, and it will take two weeks to reach the second million mark some time today.  Six countries now surpass China in the total number of confirmed cases,  viz:</li>

<ul>
	<li>United States          584,862 cases</li>

	<li>Spain                      170,099 cases</li>

	<li>Italy                        159,516 cases</li>

	<li>France                    136,779 cases</li>

	<li>Germany                129,207 cases</li>

	<li>United Kingdom        88,621 cases</li>

	<li>China                       82,160 cases</li>
</ul>

	<li>United States has become the foremost epicentre of the Covid-19 pandemic, recording  584,862 confirmed cases, with 23,555 deaths.  United States  registered the first case of Covid-19 as South Korea on January 20, but South Korea has  kept its confirmed cases to 10,537 cases and 217 deaths, setting the gold standard of flattening the curve. New York state has also established a tragic milestone, as it has more Covid-19 patients than any country in the world, aside from the United States. The state's total of 188,694  cases  is higher than Spain's (170,099  cases) and Italy's (159,516), countries with populations many times larger than New York. The disease is killing New Yorkers disproportionately. Of the 23,555 deaths in the United States, 9,385 or 40%, have occurred in New York. Its mortality rate is 4.9%, compared with 4% in the rest of the country;</li>


 

	<li>In ASEAN, Philippines has overtaken Malaysia in having the most number of confirmed Covid-19 cases: 4,932 cases with 315 deaths as compared to Malaysia’s 4,817 cases with 77 deaths. Third is Indonesia with total number of  4,557 Covid-19  cases with 399 deaths.</li>
